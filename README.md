## üí° Project Inspiration

Detoxify was inspired by [Harkirat Singh's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz9K1e3LO4M) on building Chrome extensions. His guidance and teaching approach provided the foundation for this project. This extension exists as a contribution to the knowledge Harkirat shared, taking his concepts further by implementing AI-powered content filtering for YouTube.

The project aims to continue the spirit of innovation that Harkirat encourages in his content, helping users create more meaningful experiences online.

## üéØ What Detoxify Does

Detoxify transforms your YouTube browsing experience by:

- Letting you specify exactly what type of content you want to see
- Using Gemini AI to instantly detect videos matching your preferences
- Filtering out content that doesn't align with your specified interests
- Automatically removing distracting shorts and unwanted videos
- Providing a cleaner, more focused YouTube feed tailored to your needs

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Set Your Preferences**: Simply type in what categories of content you're interested in
