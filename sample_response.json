chessboard mirrors the city bold moves intricate strategies and endless possibilities and as the pressure builds today will the Challenger find their footing or will ding EX end his lead the stage is set for the next chapter of the world championship welcome everybody to our coverage of game number three I am John Sargent joined as always by the effervescent grandmas Judith pgar how are you doing Jud good morning I'm fine I'm very excited myself for game three there's an awful lot on the line today I feel like the tension has been rising a little bit I know we've had uh World Championships in the past where we've had draw after draw to begin with as players feel each other out we've had that imbalance from day one Jud and it just feels like the atmosphere is a little bit different as a result oh absolutely game one was an incredible start of this event this world championship because everybody thought even dingler and himself called himself an underdog in this match and we've SE it's not going that way right now because he played very well he took his chances he his opportunities which was given by gcash in game one very interesting and sharp game great calculation by dings at some point he played so fast it was incredible after thinking so much in the opening and game two was kind of solid maybe in some ways it was too solid when ding decided to go for a draw after less than two three hours of play so this is game number three now for those of you who are joining our broadcast for the first time or want to catch up on exactly what happened yesterday we've got you covered let's take a look at a little bit of a recap of day two well dingly Ren take a solid approach because he has shown a propensity for one E4 E4 has indeed been played Rome wasn't built in a day but I think the Italian might be built up on the board in just a couple of seconds here Judith so he's in a very good mood and definitely today he wants to try it I would think that gash will also be more solid than yesterday quite a lot of tension with the bones but he plays A5 look at that how are they still blitzing moves I mean either of the Bishops can be captured by either side and neither side is capturing either of them this is a surprising move for me keeping the tension so I think it was a very smart choice by Ding and it is very uncomfortable for gash I would think that for gash the draw would be just a perfect result for today and then move on for the next one king G7 is an indication that he's happy with the construction of his Rooks and minor pieces super high level Chaz John from both sides here thus far it's not entirely clear what White's next move is feels like a bit of an exasperated move by ding just feels like he's he's tired of the you know the covian maneuvering and he's just like let's sign the score sheets get some pieces off the board and let's make title Tuesday you're a good thing you got another four hours and gash says I got another four hours you see he doesn't want to make a draw he wants to play on Knight C6 back and it's a clear indication right that that this means not necessarily GES isn't sacking a knight but he's keeping pieces on the board unfor yeah what happens if I go R D6 with an idea that after Knight D3 Knight D7 though it's hard to imagine that black can go for more actually Knight D3 Knight D4 might be o we have a repetition there wow and they're repeating and they're repeating furiously they both seem to have just decided enough is enough I'm suris but Jud there I thought black could have been worse right if White's Knight gets to D3 it's the game hangs in the balance and we see a handshake well that was anticlimactic that decision took place in the course of 5 Seconds G Cas was like all right let's make the draw and ding didn't hesitate for a single second did your win in round one affect your choice of openings in this round actually we discussed uh before the match and we prepared to play the first game with start first game start first why game with E4 and yeah my second convinced me to play E4 although I'm quite uncertain about the a lot of possibilities after that by and I decided to follow their advice and you told us that you actually got some messages after your round one win were those private messages to your phone or did you go online to read what others had to say about your game uh no no uh it's most the message come to my phone and uh yeah I didn't check the a news in the Cy can you tell us how many messages you got 5 10 100 no no not so much not as much as the time I win the world championship match it's around around 20 okay that's still quite a lot and finally um when you go home are you going to discuss today's game with Richard report or do you guys go right into the discussion of the next round game well of course first we will talk about today's game see where I made me some mistakes and then I will we will prepare a little bit for tomorrow's game so here is the score as it stands dingly Ren the world champion is one and a half two a half up over GES domaru in the world championship match two games down with the third game to be played today uh psychologically the stakes are getting high but at the same time Judith let's not pretend this is the absolute Pinnacle final game or anything like that gukesh has got a little bit of pressure ding has proven to us that Peak ding has shown up to the match which is amazing cuz we were wondering if he was going to regain some of his previous form but honestly we're still at the stage of the match where anything can happen oh absolutely the match is 14 games long and we can say it and maybe we don't really understand how long it is I mean to stand that pressure what the players are now living through as Anand who is very experienced and Magnus Carlson also they always explain how tough it is to play such a mess game three is something that the players warmed up already I think they more or less start to understand each other who takes what kind of risks but today I'm waiting for a very exciting game potentially over 100 hours at a chess board facing the same Challenger over 14 matches it could go that sort of distance so a tremendous amount of pressure indeed uh we're a couple of minutes away from the first moves in game number three folks but before we go to that uh let's catch up with Mike Klein who earlier today showed us a lovely external shot of the venue well here we are before round three in the rainy season of Singapore we're on the mainland but the battle is taking place on santosa island behind me specifically Hotel Aquarius which should be right there luckily the players don't have to get wet on the way to the match they just have to come downstairs from the eighth floor to the second floor and what about the match well statistically things are not looking good for the Challenger gach because there's been 15 previous one-on-one matches where a player has led one and a half to one half going into round three and that player has gone on to win 73% of the time G of course is looking for his first advantageous position ding's big problem right now seems to be sleep he admitted to me he didn't sleep much before game one and then Chinese media got him to admit he didn't sleep much after he won game one he was up until 3:00 a.m. probably getting some of those congratulatory text messages from his friends so we're going to head inside we're going to see what's going to happen in game three will GES press again as white what's he going to do going into the rest day everything is to be determined now back to you guys thank you very much for that mic insightful as always I don't want to pick up on one of those points there Judit because I smell some Mind Games was it ding who said oh I always get a great night's sleep before every game don't even worry about it what Mike said there sounds a little bit contradictory to me well sleeping is one of the most serious issue in such an event I had always a great sleep so I was very good competitor from this point of view but of course Ding and of course also for gkes it's a big question how well they sleep if they can sleep well it's already a huge thing in such an event I think even I didn't sleep so well when it was before game one I knew that okay they are awake already I'm still sleeping oh my God what they have experiencing you know so it must be very very tough but it is very important for them to get a good sleep because they have to make decisions today's game also I think it will be at least four five hours possibly and there are many situations where you need your calm head to be able to make the right decision and um yeah of course what the players are saying and how they're saying and what are they feeling we don't know exactly how much they are giving away all the secrets and uh but I do hope that the players get a good sleep because then we're going to see better games and they also feel much better about themselves so it's not all about ding chilling you can tell really that uh the nerves are real even when you're ahead or maybe especially if you are ahead in the world championship match today's game promises to be a bit of a slug hopefully we'll see a much longer game than we saw yesterday although that was fighting as well you can go ahead and let us know who you think is going to win uh with prizes on offer as well so if you go ahead and head to the feed World Championship page on the chess.com website and go into games you can

players are getting ready to hop into the playing Hall itself I'm looking forward to seeing how today is going to go down but we've decided to manifest a little bit of energy here as we bring in a couple of additional voices to the conversation Judith It's been a pleasure it always is a pleasure chatting to you and we're going to continue chatting with you but I would like to bring someone else onto the broadcast as well we have been manifesting the energy for the last 20 minutes chat has just been sending us Good Vibes and I'm pleased to report that out of the smoke the thin wispy bits of smoke that have appeared on the side of our screen a Robert Hess has appeared out of nowhere Robert good to see you again mate how you doing thank you John the problem was that I could only hear myself which is a huge issue especially when you have the legendary Jud vgar on the other end helping us out with the analysis so John thanks so much for the welcome Judith always great to see you I'm super excited great to see you very different circumstances today of course Robert the last time we were on screen together we were hopping through what a game every 5 or 10 minutes it was absolutely manic this is a completely different kettle of fish it is one game only one outcome that matters uh high stakes world championship match we have veteran versus Challenger who's never played a match before like there's so much to talk about in terms of context but can you help us identify what the one biggest thing you're looking forward to dissecting is today can is there one factor in this match that you're excited about more than anything else I'm just looking forward to see if we'll repeat openings because in the first game of course dingly Ren trotted out the French defense which is rare at the highest level he said he wanted to test his young opponent who does not have match experience and I guess can speak this better than anybody you know when you're playing at this high level those nerves they really will trickle in at the start of an event and then you may get settled and if we remember back to 2018 Fabio Carana was on the absolute knocking on the door of defeat and he saved that first game and then the nerve settled in and he played a great match up until the tie break so perhaps gesh he wasn't lucky in the first game but his skill will shine here on out all right well let's go ahead and toss things over to Grandmas Maurice Ashley as we get round number three underway I suspect we'll get ceremonial first moves and stuff as well let's hear what they've got to say championships 2024 held here at the Aquarius hotel at the luxurious Resorts world santosa in beautiful Singapore I'm Maurice Ashley and it is my pleasure to introduce the two players who are competing for the title of world World chess champion first the Challenger from India gukesh dearu and hailing from China the world champion ding Len I have to say that Singapore has been a fan fantastic host nation so far they have treated the players like royalty and even we staff as royalty as well the fans have been out in droves the enthusiasm is through the roof the food my goodness the food I'm trying not to gain 10 pounds by the time this trip is over from how amazing the food has been it has indeed been quite an experience and I think it will go down as one of the great places to host a World Chess Championship and one of the people responsible for all this wonderful hospitality is here with us today to make the ceremonial first move he is the lead independent director of DBS group Holdings Limited and DBS Bank limited as well as the Director of Raffles Medical Group he is the chairman of starhub limited please welcome the chairman of the Singapore Singapore tourism board Mr Olivier limb Mr limb will make the first move as white thank you please and with that let the game begin game number three of the Fay World Championship is officially a go gesh has made the first move it's going to be 1 D4 so we're seeing a little bit of mixing things up here absolutely love to see it let's see what the game will bring I'm going to bow out at this point and leave you in the hands of our two esteemed Grandmaster commentators Judith pogar and Robert Hess take it away folks thank you so much John and Judith we have to talk about the big storyline and it's only been a single move one D4 from GES a pause from dingly Ren as he thinks what does GES want from me are you surprised to see a new opening move from the young Indian Superstar well I'm not very surprised to be honest because this is a good repertoire of of gash starting with D4 and I think it's still the phe in the match where they they trying to feel each other where are the weak spots and one E4 in the first game uh it was a good choice then it was a French defense chosen by ding which was little bit provocative provoking gesha I believe but now I I think somehow gkes starts also calming down and maybe he goes for a more solid choice I must say but we are going to see this I think in the in the match as in every match we see always that they're alternating their choices already even from the first move 100% true and we see that we have our first exchange of the day a pawn capture on D5 so that's an early decision from gesh it all allows black to take back with the pawn if he so chooses opening up this bishop on C8 or in some positions you take back with the Knight or Bishop B4 checks to throw in so Judith we've seen these positions many many times it's not about maybe the individual moves but the overall strategies that the players will adopt and gukesh he is trotting out his moves very quickly at the start dingly ran a little bit at a more Ginger pace so what do you expect I think overall picture and what do you think we're going to see in this third game well uh the first question is for me whether how fast ding is going to be playing because in game one it was he made the first surprise I must say that he played the French still it seemed like GES is very well prepared he knows what he's doing until move 10 or something on the G4 he he was working it out so it was ding who was spending a lot of time in the opening and only later on he speeded up his play and uh uh yesterday it was completely different time management for the players I'm very curious whether GES can pose this kind of questions and problems to things so he's going to be spending again so much time already at a very early phase of the game or he's just going to be very happy with his position playing uh different developing moves at this point I'm not sure cd5 ed5 uh already at such an early stage he was expecting gash to be playing this line but I think it is a very important part how dink will be reacting and how fast he will be reacting and how great comfortable position gash will be able to reach and then of course later I'm very curious how gukesh will uh uh make his aggressive very straightforward uh moves and continuation yeah I mean in that first game in the French defense it was sharp at an early stage and for GES he was in preparation until the moment he wasn't and things from there fell apart a bit and now we see this is Mainline Theory you mentioned Judith that capturing on D5 this early might come as a bit of a surprise to dingl Ren the world champion and it opens up that light score Bishop on C8 which is typically a problematic piece in these variations so what about this do you think that dingly Ren he's seen this position many times before but what do you think in this moment he's considering is there something if you were ding you'd want to avoid given gash's prowess and certain variations generally speaking when players are thinking at this such a early stage of the game they not necessarily are usually in a world championship match I think he will not be thinking about uh exactly calculating should I be playing Bishop F5 C6 Bishop D6 Bishop C B4 whatever uh moves or Bishop E7 uh but he's more thinking about the Strate iic idea what kind of position he wants to play and more thinking about what gash has in mind what gash wants to reach out of this opening choice and uh this is uh a very important uh question because this is at the in the first eight 10 12 moves this is part of the bottle that we try to understand each other what the opponent wants because of course you may choose something different if it's uh equally good move or you're playing both kind of moves then you try to choose something that uh it can be a surprise or unexpected or or maybe against your opponent style to to make those moves but for now I think both are quite comfortable nothing serious has happened yet we are only in move six for the moment Queen C2 was played clearly the move which is stopping Bishop F5 to be developed to death Square so right now it's placing the pieces to the right Square yes and we're not going to over dramatize this early stage of the third game of the match it is a long match indeed and queen C2 it stops Bishop F5 is you just highlighting I mean the move C6 is always a good one just trying to create a nice little Pawn chain here from B7 to D5 that way all of our pawns feel safe and sound and I think one of the big questions in a moment like this if you are ding Ren is do you just play the natural developing move Bishop E7 or do you play this move G6 which is extremely common in this opening but it can create some dark Square problems for you later on so uh these early moves you know we see that dingly run he's the one spending time I guess it is all about adapting to your opponent's style here Judith well absolutely I mean playing G6 or developing Bishop E7 it's a very serious Choice which should not be the case that D is actually coming up with this or that of course he he must know what he's feeling comfortable with what structure because it goes a very different direction because once you go G6 of course the primary idea is to bring the bishop out to F5 before the white Bishop can develop to D3 so uh black is just in time to bring his Bishop to F5 but uh and also probably there the the Bishops white square Bishops can be exchanged white plays Bishop D3 exchanging or moving away with the queen but the bishop from black side is going to be going fian chto putting it on G7 so that is already quite a different uh setup from black than just to play Bishop E7 and castle and um so this is uh this is kind of a we'll see in which direction the game is going to be ER going and I I just want to point out one funny thing here that often times after Bishop G5 pinning this Knight black doesn't even play Bishop G7 which is perfectly reasonable but often plays Bishop to E7 just breaking that pin which is kind of counterintuitive Judah we teach our students not to create holes on one side of the board here I mean these dark squares are whites for the taking but that pin is really important especially when the king remains in the center well you know as they say we have the principles and the practice and there are not many occasions when they meet each other so in princip we play G6 to put the bishop on G7 also partly but actually in practice we can put the bishop on E7 so it's I mean chess is becoming also different these days back uh let's say 20 30 years ago it was much more classical we had much more the general understanding of Chess you have to develop with your pieces you don't make weaknesses you custle you put your king into safety you have to play in harmony with your pieces many of these things things we see G6 played actually so many of these things are still the case but it became much more concrete than it was before in my teenage times I was always playing very concretely and people were looking at me quite strangely sometimes but these days I think with the engines around that everybody is working with the with the computers engines ideas for example these days we cannot really say on any move that this is impossible possible you know this is impossible to be good this is what engines and computers brought to us that we can't believe anything or we are not criticizing anything on that level as we did before ag3 you know J just as you were saying you know I was as you were talking I was thinking about H3 being played because you know in the older times they would say what are you doing wasting a Tempo you should develop your pieces get your king castle you know play in that classical style but H3 J does that hint to you that there could be a future G4 we keep talking about black wants to plant a bishop on F5 so even if the bishop gets there with Tempo the White Queen will step out the way and later we may see that trademark gash G4 Pawn push and then we might see a chaotic game uh yes and this is also the kind of move I think we can say that 30 years ago when someone would be playing H3 in this position you might think at first that the reason is because you don't want the bishop Bishop to come to G4 these days when we see paone moving H3 the first idea is yeah the bishop comes to G4 but maybe actually it's more because he wants to play G4 at some point this is exactly the times we're living in and absolutely G4 is something very close to my heart in general and I have this uh this image I think quite well but these days also others have have this this move uh something that they are just very happy or just have no problem to make such a moves and I think G4 we might see in this game in a later stage uh taking away some space from black species and I just want to check the database here uh this position is quite rare So whereas before H3 the position had been played many times this Choice 7h3 from gash it's taking this game into familiar territory at least if we can believe dingl Ren's expression and maybe his upcoming time usage and every player from the black side played Bishop F5 that of course that was the reason you played G6 but I think dingler Ren isn't pausing about Bishop F5 he's wondering if this queen steps up to B3 to put pressure down on the queen side when will G4 happen what are the consequences of that pawn push later I mean these are Big questions swirling in ding Len's head right now and it's gukesh who comes up with the first opening surprise actually gash is doing these kind of things right to come up with Novelties and and these days we have different kind of uh Novelties and surprises for the players because it's not necessarily you believe that it is very much the best move but you analyze it and work it out at home so you get familiar with the ideas and the depth of it and this way it can be problematic for a game for your opponent and I think I think it's also very important in a match that you are the one who is leading the opening battle every day is it you who is going to be surprising your opponent every day or as much as possible or your opponent so this is also a psychological battle in some ways and of course if you make a new move and uh give some questions to your opponent it can be very useful gaining a lot of time so you make your opponent think a lot of course Bishop F5 was played right I mean if you play G6 you cannot do anything else after that you go Bishop F5 Queen B3 attacking on B7 attacking but Judah I was going to ask this maybe uncomfortable question for at least from the black's perspective here is Queen B6 automatic and if that's the case we're talking about G4 we're talking about potential aggressive intentions and just because the Queens are off the board if they do get traded that doesn't mean that we will have a dull game it still could promise a lot of excitement but my question is you know if you're thinking about this type of position here Queen B6 just trying to protect your B7 Pawn getting the white Queen's path offer a queen trade whose style would a queenless position favor more I guess you might say it depends on the position but I'm I'm just generally asking you think the end game is a better strong point for either of these two players well first of all I would say that after Queen B6 if there is a queen exchange I wouldn't call it as an end game I would call it as a midle game without Queens because I think it would be extremely complicated and a lot of suppes going on in in that position first of all who takes the queen so who is going to have the double pawns that's also already a good start of the question and um I think generally GES likes to play very straightforward I I would say that uh I think gash is more liking to play with Queens but of course at this level both players are simply so great and such a good players that uh in this case you want to have a good position and that's good with queens or without Queens so at this point uh then you are at such a level you can't really be very much picky so you can't really say that he goes for the end game he goes for the middle game or sharp positions we can say I think that gash likes sharp positions and a lot of calculation is somewhere he feels comfortable with and you ask who will take the opponent's Queen and double the pawns we've quickly seen Queen B6 met with G4 and I want to Second what you were just saying that these players they're so versatile they can play with Queens without Queens when one person has a queen and they have a rook in a minor piece for example so imbalances you know Queen trades simple end games complex attacking games it doesn't matter and one of gash's best games that I've seen recently was in the Olympiad against dingl Ren's compatriot and good friend Grandmaster ve that end game was superb the two nights Against The Rook he ended up getting to the other side just a little bit quicker and winning that game which was all important for Team India but now we're in an individual match we are in the world championship and we do have another G4 sighting so Judith instead of answering the question that you posed perhaps rhetorically who is going to trade Queens is black going to say yes my Bishop's under attack but let me first double and isolate your pawns but of course there the benefit for white of opening up the a file and The Rook on A1 can be active or do we think a bishop move is in order and the Queens will stay on the board for at least another turn well right now there is a big question for dink to decide on can he take the queen capture and then put his Bishop into White's Camp by playing Bishop C2 immediately attacking the pawn on B3 and then white has to be protecting it I believe with Knight D2 and then the question is whether the C2 Bishop is a is a a bishop which is in danger or not but actually now I'm looking at it that maybe bishop G5 can be an intermediate move and if white could be going Bishop G5 and only after that Knight D2 then with Rook C1 the black Bishop can really be get in trouble but now Knight E4 would come probably um so it's a question how it is it becomes suddenly pretty concrete because if white can bring out the bishop that's a completely different story if Bishop G5 is not possible but white has to go Knight D2 then it's not so easy for white to develop uh his species so so this is question number one for ding I think but there should he be taking on B3 playing Bishop C2 or if he moves back with the bishop he might as well just move back and keep the tension to E6 let's say yeah I think your point is that if white ends up taking on B6 and then black takes back AB we see that these pawns are actually connected so it's a better version from the black side of having these double pawns The Rook on A8 is activated and then we can play moves like B5 and be pestering that Knight on C3 with B4 so white wouldn't have that option because there would be double isolated pawns these are just double pawns not isolated from the black side so I think both options look completely reasonable at this stage Jud did I mean I like what you're talking about with if black says let me try to win this Pawn directly just to go down this line I really like what you were highlighting that even this Pawn I'm not sure that it's that easy to grab from uh the black side and moves maybe even Bishop F4 because he attacks this uh Knight on B8 with A7 as well being quite loose I think Bishop F4 is the is the move what you just pointed out and actually after Bishop B3 not even to take on B8 but just to go Knight D2 and the black Bishop can get in trouble very fast so after all it seems like this is is not an option Queen takes and Bishop C2 it's funny you know you go for that pawn and then you take it and you're like why did I do all this for what your Bishop just gets trapped and I like what you're saying that instead of taking on B8 and taking it a pawn back a lot of players myself included were like let me just restore material equality get some activity for it but you're saying just trap the bishop you play G4 for a reason yeah and it's uh it's very much gash that everywhere he's going to be going into the very active uh Direction I believe I'm with you there so gesh he's the one who decided on a new approach and he also decided on a new first move from the white side in this match D4 in game three here instead of starting with E4 as he did in the first one so Jude the question is still on the table right now will black take the queen on B3 gash he seems very calm dingly Ren is the one spending some time and maybe this is just going to be the theme of the match as you were indicating that it's going to be ding down 20ish minutes after every opening well uh we'll see how much ding is going to be thinking at this point but uh it it starts to be I I'm not sure it's clear but uh I mean that is clear that goash made a surprise and he's leading the the the opening phe of the game and this was in game one as well now the big question is how ding will be reacting and handling this kind of surprise and he's handling it by thinking and thinking and thinking and the lack of increment that can be very scary as dingly Ren knows extremely well because in his match against Yan pishi there was that game where he was better then suddenly it was unclear and then suddenly he's about to lose on time and that game was quite tragic at least in the moment before he was able to Roar back in the match so I mean spending this much time this early FAO Carana said on the C Square podcast like everyone needs to calm down the top players you know they all know what they're doing Judi yourself included but then there are other moments where we're like are we giving them too much credit you know they're thinking and we say okay they're doing the right thing they need to think and then suddenly they have 10 moves to make but only 10 seconds and then it's just pure chaos and pandemonium well uh the time factor in chess it is very special and very important and I remember when I was a small kid we still had a journ games I'm not even sure that many of our audiences know what is that it's basically in in tournaments you had two hours for each side and after you finished move 40 and you spend all your time you're going to have a sealed move so you're are putting in an envelope your move and then in two hours later after dinner you come back and continue the game so of course in those days everything was very slow many maor games which meant that if you had a good coach good trainer then you could analyze it it was not it was against the rules but of course nobody could stop it right so in those times that's why the Soviet players were having a huge Advantage because they always had some friends around to help them out but of course later on all these time controls the a journ game was disappearing when the engines and computer help could could be part of it and then there were different kind of time controls I remember when all these transition was going on I played like I think seven tournaments with eight different time controls because it was so messy you have small less time more time bonus time whatever so it is a very very different game sometimes if you have a bonus time from starting from move one like 30 seconds or you played as we play now the world championship match where the extra 30 second comes only after move 41 so it can be very tricky it also happened with some of the top players like ivanchuk or karpov or others who are time trouble players that uh when it was fashion to have bonus time after every move and then they played in the tournament where they didn't have and they simply forgot it that there is no bonus time so it can change the game quite a bit but here the players of course they know what they are uh uh what time control they are playing so they have to be very very very mindful of that that what's going on but at the same time it's just the opening and uh of course ding experienced it many times that he spends a lot of time at certain part of the game and then he has to speed up well we'll see if he does just that as you were talking about a blast from the past and the adjournments and being able to take your sweet time here dingly ran he has a fin night amount so why don't we take this moment as dingly ran is still on the clock deliberating whether or not he wants to trade Queens to bring back in John Sergeant because John I know you've been waiting in the wings looking at all the action what do you make of what's happened thus far I think this is a really fun way to open round number three Robert at the end of the day we know that it's a different opening uh we were asking ourselves at the very start of the broadcast okay what's going to be different what's the point and I feel like we've had our first answer there with G4 on move 9 uh where gukesh is saying okay this is how I want to play this game and ding is rightly settling into a deep think um Judith when you're in this sort of position it this is interesting for me because it's quite transparent gukesh has an hour and 59 minutes left on the clock we know that this is an opening that was decided on where gesh probably has something quite sharp planned down the line ding has to sit and think he knows he's going to go 20 minutes half an hour down on the clock at this point all cards on the table no one's hiding anything if you're the player now who has to respond to this sort of preparation and you know that later on you need to find some resources to make your opponent think as well to ease the pressure on the clock to make life a little bit easier for you what's going through your head at moments like this it's not just about finding the correct move to play In This Moment ding must be thinking about all sorts of things further down the line as well this could get like really quite multifaceted at this point I think he's really busy about what's going on on the board like what is this idea what thees is playing what he has the idea behind it why he played this what are the the small details that count in this position and he does not think too much about the time I believe because he has plenty of time here it's much more important to make the best decision what he can uh he can do so he is going to be spending some time and decide on that uh to move as far as I see probably Queen B3 Bishop C2 what which we discussed with Robert is not the right move so a little bit I feel that black is losing this small battle that he went Bishop with F5 and after G4 he will have to move back and uh and it is something that maybe he's not so comfortable with but also he can uh think about it can I play Bishop E4 or to play something else and the thing is that when you come up with a new idea like this like gkes and his theme of course they know a lot of small details about it and this is what dink has to be counting on that if I do this if I do that if it becomes very concrete of course I'm very much in behind in understanding the position so do I have enough self-confidence myself that I'm going to be handling the right way even though maybe there is It's a Jungle of uh different moves and opportunities so at this point it is probably quite unpleasant for ding to sit there after G4 and make his decision but of course he's the world champion so he has to be ready for these kind of difficult questions so a lot of internalizing and Judith a great summary of all the different kinds of questions that will be going through ding's head right now as he Ponders his response to G4 from gukesh uh arguably the first potential Haymaker in this opening Salvo as we start to take a look at what the middle game might

moves played on the board now uh Judit while we were away we've had some major decisions being made although the outcome of the game is still far from certain absolutely ding was not thinking so long so much time and he took the challenge so he took on B3 and Contin continued the journey with his Bishop all the way to C to attacking White's bone this is what we were discussing with Robert and uh after a few seconds uh the bishop was out on the board by gukesh so it seems still of course gkes is very much deeply in his preparation contrary to his opponent I believe and Robert this might not be entirely new to history as you pointed out while we were off air as well very Eagle eyed of you there it looks like uh very comfortable with what he's doing and ding may be trying to search the memory banks a little bit well you study your great predecessors Gary Kasparov may have written the book but everybody should do it and we see the position on the board white has just played the move 12 rooked over from H1 to G1 and this has been seen before at the very highest level I say my great predecessors because former world champion Vladimir kumnick he played this opening from the white side against none other than Arjun aragi another Superstar from India so Judit as we talk about how the players they study the openings how they play their games this isn't novel stuff just yet but Judith for kukesh we know he decided to play this opening for dingly Ren there's actually a pretty reasonable chance he's seen this before given how quickly he played the queen capture followed with Bishop C2 and H5 well after G4 actually Queen capture was the most natural move for continuation that's very clear because you just don't want to move back with the bishop Giving Up tempos So if black can rescue his Bishop from C2 which probably or should be the case then uh this is obviously the most straightforward decision what ding was doing and um yeah this we don't know exactly how much ding knows this position right but of course having your Bishop on C2 you have to be extremely careful what you're doing because you're you're don't pay attention for a move and your Bishop is gone so that's definitely something ding does not want to see but uh this is what the battle is about right now that how the C2 Bishop will cause trouble for white instead of being cotent losing it it's a really big question here because I know many people in the audience they would say is isn't this Pawn on B3 just hanging you put your Bishop on C2 to snag that pawn so why not take it right now and I just want to show you know I know we've gone over similar lines and H takes G4 was just included but Bishop takes B3 after GES he's going to immediately take back on G4 if you play Bishop takes B3 you're just getting yourself into trouble the same way as earlier Knight D2 your Bishop can survive for a turn Rook C1 The Bishop's getting kicked about and after the bishop goes to E4 then Pawn to F3 and the bishop is fully trapped you are losing that piece for just a pawn and it's only going to be two pawns for that lost minor piece so Judith that seems very clear obvious to both players but we're going to have to keep reminding ourselves I believe that you know at some point as we did see H takes G4 the pawns have been swapped there may be an opportunity for black to take it so we should table it for now to store that idea in our back pocket because it doesn't work but maybe in the future there's some configuration of pieces where in fact Bishop takes B3 will be on the cards I would still consider it to go back to this bishop B3 line because after Knight D2 Bishop C4 would be a possibility to continue the game trying to save the bishop so I'm wondering what do you think how this uh would be followed should white be taking on C4 and just play E4 centralize his pawns or can the bishop be catched I like what you're saying though just uh taking on C4 and and playing in the center with E4 or even E3 kind of reminds me of the Queen's Gambit accepted right where black has an extra Pawn at least temporarily but white has this great control over the center and that game that we referenced of crnic against aragi it actually went down this exact path where cnick instead of playing E4 two squares forward he went one square with E3 and this Pawn of course is in serious danger and if you get greedy Judit we know that you often pay a price you just trying to protect your pawns with B5 I think we have a simple tactic here for white that just wins the game Knight B5 yeah give me that right take a piece lose a rook in the corner and that's why you have to develop your pieces everyone okay this is something that uh of course uh ding will not do I believe because to give up this white square Bishop uh and give up the center completely usually it gives white at least enough compensation in these kind of positions so let's see what ding has in mind to continue the game whether Knight E4 possibly or maybe bishop B4 uh there are some alternative but black has to be I think very careful at this point and very exact yeah I liked your knight4 suggestion that looks completely reasonable to me but I get the sense that gukesh he knows exactly what to respond with and that's the problem at this stage of the world championship match in this particular game is Judith you know you're a star you uh can play and find all these great moves but they take time right we can suggest four different options for black but one may actually be very problematic and the other two of the other three may be just now worse for black and then only one is like completely stabilizing but this isn't the type of position where it's symmetrical Pond structure we're just liquidating and trying to defend a slightly worse position there are a lot of tactical possibilities here Judy and I know that's very much your style and it certainly is gesha as well yes uh of course many things comes down to very concrete tactical calculation but also there is a many times that there is some calculation at the at the end some uh little better position arises and uh it happens many times right but here uh really black has to be careful very much how to continue here this the movement even that we had an arrow for Knight E4 I'm wondering can that actually solve all of Black's problems or is that Bishop on C2 still so trapped in enemy territory that it will come back to haunt dingly Ren who did place his Bishop there he could have retreated instead he went forward and I guess Judah Knight E4 that's one move we talked about Bishop B4 is another uh I guess you can try to develop this knight from B8 but is that too slow with Knight to D7 I mean all of these are options I can name even a few more but I'm getting worried for ding if I'm being honest he's already down 30 plus minutes on the clock gcash is still within his preparation and this is a not the type of position where you can just play with your hand you have to think and calculate every single turn yes indeed and I see an interesting line for examp example after Knight E4 the first question is how white is reacting but let's say white is capturing on e4 what do you think so after Black Goes Knight E4 let's say white uh goes Knight E4 and after d takes E4 my plan would be to go Knight D2 threatening immediately to catch the bishop with Rook C1 and after Bishop B4 so after Rook C1 black would be taking on B3 because of the pin V can go Bishop uh White can go instead of Rook C1 I think Rook G3 oh what do you think about that protecting the pawn on B3 and nothing can stop V playing Rook C1 next move I think my reaction did all the Talking I needed to that is beautiful full board awareness and maybe one of the ideas Rook G1 was needed because there was a tension between H&G pawns but that is just lovely stuff just catching that bishop and I see the feature chat from our good friend GM nitzki da hello go to sleep I think it's really past your bedtime by now but Judah the question that we're trying to figure out is like how do you extricate the bishop because uh you know Bishop E5 for white may be not a threat he's pointing out just to go back to the live position that any moment Bishop E5 is met by Knight D7 which is very useful otherwise Pawn to G5 would help put pressure on the pin piece but yeah the question that we're asking how do you actually save this bishop Judith Knight E4 does not seem to ex exactly solve all of Black's problems there but there is another detail also if Knight E4 Knight E4 we don't capture it with the pawn but going with the bishop to E4 with the idea of playing if Knight D2 attacking the bishop like trying to exchange Bishop B4 let's say and then white plays F3 then Bishop C2 then the third rank is uh is already covered by The Rook the pawn on F3 so Rook G3 doesn't work right so there are a lot of small details in these kind of positions that's what uh I want to point out that uh there are really small details where maybe you lose or you save your Bishop right I love this variation because it goes to show that if you are tunneling in on let me trap that Bishop that's all I'm focused on you may not actually succeed because you need that third rank open this is such a great illustration Judith of how uh having that single-minded Focus on one specific idea you have to look at the nuances there and I think if I just back up here I saw that the engine off to the left of our board the quite high up King D1 exactly looking really strong getting out of the pin opening up the attack and white is clearly the side for choice and I don't like this position at all for black Bishop Bishop on e4 is just a huge travel it could get trapped you could even just capture it and take the two Bishops advantage in an open board so Jud this is starting to be quite worrisome for the world champion he's looked good in the first two games but here in game three I mean if we just hop back to the live position we're talking about this Knight E4 move because we're trying to stop Rook C1 and Knight D2 in some move order dingly Ren is desperately trying to figure a way out here and I am nervous for him I mean he is down serious time right now and it's not just the clock I think in fact it's the board that poses even more problems because he is not familiar and his opponent is yeah but what is uh surprising for me that there was this CR game before exactly on this so it is it is something that is pretty annoying if the position is really verse for black that it's not even a completely novelty ER for for objectively in this position so we should somehow find something for ding why while he's thinking so maybe bishop B4 or after Bishop B4 Knight D2 and uh black is in trouble yeah let's go Bishop B4 Knight D2 as you mentioned just simply protecting this Pawn also covering the E4 square and the ideas are this straightforward Judi it's it's just not the type of position from dingly Ren's perspective where you're like oh at least I have an opportunity to muddy the waters like the moves are actually pretty obvious from the white side and I know from my experience Jud when I play positions like this I'm in my own head I'm like no matter what I do my Bishop's getting caught I don't know what to do to get it out of there and you start like worrying yourself and then you start desperately trying to find ways to survive and not go down a pawn for example so in is this look any more appealing to you or is it still just kind of more of the same well it looks very scary for my Bishop on C2 so what I'm thinking about maybe not to play Bishop B4 but what about uh get to the help of the C2 Bishop with the Knight Knight to A6 with the Knight d8 that if Rook C1 then Knight B4 so Rook C1 Knight I don't know if you go Rook C1 or Knight D2 of course right right you have the option between the two of them I think the pawn on B3 is still difficult to capture but what if I go for our other idea because da his feature chat was saying Bishop E5 there was Knight B to D7 that Knight now is out and about protecting the bishop so this looks to my eyes very unpleasant given that there's a pretty nasty pin and if you block that pin Judah is there not Bishop to D6 and yeah removing the guard yes I think this is the the big big issue for uh for black big big problem okay so Knight A6 will not work maybe there's a one line that saves the day there for black but it looks deeply unpleasant to my eye so we're kind of process of eliminating at least Bishop B4 didn't look so great knight E4 similarly looked problematic okay I mean I hate to ask the question but do we have time for Knight to D7 for example like I know you're going to play Rook C1 I know you're going to play Knight D2 but is there any Universe where this is a helpful move or are you just really playing Knight D2 next no matter what well after Knight D7 for sure Knight D2 comes to mind first and uh immediately posing question questions to think that what do you do against Rook C1 can he go C5 somehow to break up but I think it's it's kind of a panic move already yeah I mean you just can't even really just make these moves we've been talking about you have to calculate burn more time as you said Rook C1 Knight D2 first these options are easy to spot for White and the way out is very tricky for black but you know while ding is deep in thought Trump trying to extricate that Bishop uh why don't we take a look at what kind of hurdles the world champion had to face on his way to this world championship King Len made history in 2023 when he became the 17th World chess champion his journey to get there was nothing short of extraordinary ding's rise began early becoming the youngest ever Chinese champion at 16 his breakthrough on the international stage came in 2015 when he finished second in the star studded Tata steel chess event behind only Magnus Carlson from then on the Chess World knew that Ding was a force to watch ding wasn't done impr pressing scoring one of the most remarkable achievements in chess history the Chinese star went on an incredible 100 game undefeated streak between 2017 and 2018 the longest until Carlson broke it in October 2019 during the time he entered the world's top five chess players and broke the 2800 rating mark another impressive achievement came in 2019 when he won the singfield cup with an undefeated score beating Carlson in a blitz playoff ding was the first to beat Carlson in a tie break in 12 years oh my God he just made him I'm H I'm on the ding train in 20122 the 32-year-old finished second in the candidates tournament falling just short of a chance to challenge for the title however the reigning Champion Magnus Carlson then stunned the Chess World when he announced that he would not defend his title as as a result ding would face Yan nepom Nishi the winner of the candidates in a challenge for the throne the 2023 World Chess Championship was a thrilling back and forth match where ding only clinched the title after a dramatic rapid playoff as the 14 classical games ended in a 77 tie that secured him a place in history books as the first male Chinese player to become a world chess champion it's over dingler and is the world chess champion this has been a fight of Courage of and determination however life hasn't been easy for the humble grandmas since winning the title ding took a 9-month break from tournaments and later revealed that he had struggled with his mental health entering 2024 dings form has taken a deep dive his performance in Tournaments has consistently been below expectations and for the first time in history a reigning world champion has dropped out of the top 20 in the world rankings at some moment he started like bouncing up and down he's like shaking literally shaking and um he definitely doesn't seem like the same person he just seems to be off despite his challenges ding remains positive and determined when I first get the title I'm very nervous and I have some problem psychologically but now I feel much better his journey continues in Singapore and his fans will certainly be eager to see him recover his top form and show why he has become one of the greatest forces in the Chess World and that is your world champion ding L Ren who not only holds that title he had the absolute monster 100 game unbeaten streak from August 2017 through November 2018 well over a year without losing a game and not only is he good at chess he also holds a law degree from Beijing University and he's a big football fan Juventus and Bayern Munich I'm not sure how you can be fans of two different teams that I was always told when I was playing FIFA as a kid that you have to pick one and that's your squad for the rest of your life but Judith we can see that dingly Ren he is not just a chess player he has many talents off the board as well yes definitely it seems the case but right now he needs his talent on the chess board because he's playing he's defending the his title in the world championship match and he seems to be in a little trouble right now because he gave his Bishop a tour all the way to C2 into the camp of gash's area and it seems like he has to look after it very very carefully I'm kind of worried about that yeah unlike a courtroom you can't just talk your way out of this one and that Bishop there I mean it's it looks pretty trapped and you and I were talking while that video was playing before you know illustrating how great dingly Ren is and you know has been for a long time but then his play it did really take a big dip Judith right that was not good he really struggled with his mental health everyone in the chess world including us we wished him well it seems like he get off to a great start winning with black in game one but I don't think anyone would be happy about this position here in game three and one idea maybe because we're desperate maybe because we're just trying to find a way to save that Bishop without losing material is we were talking about some ideas maybe not in this specific position but with Rook G8 so that you can try to play G5 and give that Bishop some breathing room on the diagonal me Judit that looks like it's a bit desperate but maybe it's just what is necessary at this stage of the game with the bishop really stuck Behind Enemy Lines well that's a very nice idea it's a very typical uh computer kind of thinking these days of course it should come to mind to us uh also so such a move and yeah basically it can work if it works because Rook G8 and when the bishop attacks in some way then there is an intermediate move playing G5 and making space for the bishop at the same time uh I'm pretty skeptical for the moment of Black's position but there is no way that he should be in such a big trouble as it seems uh at first and okay we were analyzing already quite some lines so I'm like uh thinking very heavily and I I see ding also kind of his body language says I believe that he does not feel too comfortable at this point with the with his position and Judah it's his 13th move he has spent almost half of his allotment for uh the first time control do you think that's Weighing on him as well not just is this bishop on C2 trap I think there might be a way to get it out of there but do you think that at this point he's like I just actually have to hurry up because I'm not even going to have enough time to defend the position even if I'm playing accurate moves for the next say 10 or so no at this point I think he doesn't care about his time to be honest I think he very much cares about his Bishop because uh I mean that's the only thing what counts right now how to save poor Bishop on C2 I you can have uh all the time and if you're having trouble with that one to to escape from there then uh it doesn't matter I mean he can play a a reasonable position in a short time but uh he cannot play without the pce with lot of time that's very true so what you're saying Judith and just to make clear for everybody is okay the clock situation not ideal but right now if he doesn't find a way to not go down a pawn or you know of course if you lose the bishop absolutely then you're toast but if he doesn't find a way out in the near future with that Bishop it doesn't matter if he you give him days to think of his turn so is there anything that you see I know while we speak the wheels are turning in your head and you often have creative ways to help survive difficult positions I mean we talked about that crnic game against aragi where aragi is rapid chess took on B3 and then brought his Bishop back to C4 that doesn't look good but maybe it's not so bad I say without any confidence whatsoever well bad or not bad for the moment I see it seems like the only escaping route for the bishop which does not uh seemed to be making black very happy because uh it gives up the the bishop and it seemed the the way the game went if he can move it on the board Bishop B3 Knight D2 Bishop C4 V is going to capture on C4 so the center is completely white and in this position I think it is probably the best move TR played E3 to push it only one step and not two because he wants to keep the option for his Bishop on G2 right so B5 Knight B5 that's a huge problem so black probably has to play Knight bd7 or something and then give up the pawn on C4 which leads to a clear advantageous position for white it's not only Advantage but it's like heaven you know it's like you you don't even dream about close to have such a great position with space Advantage with the bishop air weaknesses in the black Camp I mean the ace a file for The Rook without moving a single move it's attacking putting pressure you go King E2 I mean this this is something that you're very spoiled if you get this position with white right out of the opening as you said it's not even like within the possibilities when you dream up uh the opening stage and I I guess Judo if we're sort of speaking candidly Here If This Were the position that gukesh were to get we feel quite confident that white wins these types of positions very often we won't put a number on it but you feel like you're pressing with zero risk and every single move still is difficult for black because your pawns are quite weak well of course black is fighting developing his Bishop to B4 probably defending it pushing A5 and if he has an opportunity to go push B5 come with the King to E7 so of course there is going to be a fight black is is doing but it doesn't take away the fact that white has Simply Beautiful advantage and yes indeed in the best hands uh someone who is very focused and very determined as in this case goes it might be simply almost a a winning position not winning position but is a position with advantage that he is able to convert it and equalize the match so this is something definitely a position which in this case it would be a nightmare before the game to have something like this but of course now he's facing right now in a position where he has to really pay attention what happens with his C2 Bishop what are the Alternatives this is one alternative to keep the equal material but positionally it would be a worse position but for now I don't see how else he can save material the Bishop oh goodness you can see it on dingl Ren's face right now I mean he is not happy at all and he decided to bring his Bishop forward to C2 he thought perhaps this was the principal approach and maybe he didn't quite realize what he was walking into but you can see the body language of these players KES he really hasn't thought at all Judi for being honest because this has been played before and he knows that ding on the other hand he's already a bit tired he's been considering his options every single turn and now he's like all right do I just sort of swallow my pride get to that position we were just looking at where white is clearly better and you could only as we say you know dream of having such a position from the white side or does he just continue to dig deep spend time burn clock and find an alternative and one move that you know at least one idea we keep talking about is Rook G8 to try to get G5 in I don't think it you know works right off the bat but Judith I I think that must be what dingl Ren is trying to make work and maybe he is like if not now one more turn and then Rook G8 but it just looks very dicey yeah but you don't have one more turn kind of thing so why don't we check Rook G8 I mean time is very important in this position and not I'm not talking about the clock itself I'm talking about the moves whether black will be in time to play Rook G8 and G5 to escape uh rescue the Bishop from C2 so after Rook uh G8 actually the problem is or it may be that uh uh what Rook C1 is better or because after Knight D2 I believe G5 comes exactly that seems to be that uh there is an escape for the bishop and it doesn't matter whether Bishop takes B8 Rook B8 Rook A7 that is not enough for white I believe nope that extra Pawn is not B B4 and black is happy to to have his Bishop alive and uh and look for compensation probably agree with you there so if we don't like Knight to D2 you were saying that if Rook G8 you were saying Rook C1 right away just be more direct well let's see what happens here Bishop takes B3 mhm Knight D2 and the question is what is the the difference after Bishop C4 takes and E3 right I does G5 I mean that move looks a little bit annoying at least maybe Knight D5 can be an option ah you have Knight D5 as well here well after G5 I thought the bishop E5 can be just played right and I was just trying to uh get your Bishop pair if I can because I was so worried about it yeah that's true feels feels more like a fight and I just want to show that I guess Knight D5 has that uh annoying issue that Bishop G2 at the end will uh win the house oh yes B5 and C4 and B7 and all the other pawns and light squares theart yeah it really does fast in this position so um we're saying that if we go back to our analysis here so Rook G8 which we're still trying to make work it still seems like white can be very direct right Rook C1 and then chase that Bishop out of there and it's not game over as we said in the other variation but Jud I think we can all sit and appreciate this position from the white side and maybe maybe G5 wasn't best maybe G5 is possible first what do you think because you cannot you cannot go to D5 as you pointed out just before takes and Bishop G2 so if black has to move the Knight to H5 just move this bishop I don't know where you want Bishop H2 is that where you're going or I think it doesn't really matter if I'm being let's say Bishop H2 why not and just go after Bishop D2 was the other idea I had in mind aha go back this way and well I mean can I ask you Judit because I don't want to give up on this position just yet if I play Knight D7 and you push your E Pawn one or two squares I'm not sure can I play Knight B6 and protect yeah but there are a lot of problems can be happening to Black like even Bishop E2 and in some cases Knight E4 comes uh to hide lighten up the F6 weakness for black yeah it's not just even about the bishop pair anymore it's just that the weak squares in Black's position and C4 could drop in the near future anyway no I mean of course it's playable for black but it's not fun to play that's for sure as well so can I ask you a question Jud did cuz none of these positions have looked fun for me from dingly Run's perspective which position looks the most in quotes fun from the black side I don't know but this is the position it's not something you want to spend your free time with nor the world championship match any of its games but okay sometimes of course it happens that you end up in positions you don't want and you have to handle it and you have to try to survive it but this is not a nice alternative what uh what can cross your mind that okay this is one great option let's look for something else as well no here it's it's really uh dingy suffering you can you can see him suffering also I mean h and the problem is that we such an early of the game it's only move 13 that of course you're blaming yourself that how is it possible that this is what I I have right now on the board so this is also uh psychologically very difficult to digest I think I never played the world championship match myself where you have the the the pressure is is es escalated to the to the sky but generally speaking when you play a match or you play a game very important game it's for me it was always one of the biggest problem if I have a game and it's a battle and it's a fight you're calculating making mistakes okay it happens it's not a joy but it happens but when you feel that you're not even in the game you're suffering and struggling from the very beginning and and you feel like that it's it it was unnecessary that I have this uh put myself in this situation this is really frustrating apart from the fact that he has to handle this position and has to focus and cannot lose concentration and of course he sees it that Bishop B3 Knight D2 Bishop C4 takes takes E3 and it's a very unpleasant position for black but for the moment I don't see it but I'm afraid he doesn't see it also that what is better or what is the other similar at least similar or better alternative and we can see the evaluation bar to the left and I agree with that feature chatter that we just saw where you know it's a tight rope for dingly Ren right now but black isn't in that bad of shape at least according to our trusty silicon friend and that means that there's like one option and one option only that allows dingly Ren to at least be within the realm of an I mean just acceptable position so we're looking at variations we talked about Knight to E4 for black we didn't love the look of it but I think it's probably objectively speaking not that terrible but it looks difficult G8 we want to make work and maybe it just doesn't quite work the way we want in this current position we talked about Knight A6 to B4 but that didn't quite work out either so we're getting to that stage Judi where you know we've keep trying and trying and this is exactly what dingly Ren is doing right now so for those of you watching this match and thinking what is ding thinking about what's he's trying to make every single option that we just talked about work and I guess by a process of elimination at some point he just picks a move and goes with it but if we you know use our a trusty friend here and we're not going to pretend like we have all the answers but we will walk you through the processes I think as I'm seeing here that Rook G8 is the idea Judit But first you have to throw in this move Knight to D7 hoping that the White Knight drops back to D2 and then playing Rook G8 it's just like a matter of precision here but I would say that's very difficult to note that Knight D7 is actually a helpful move that works out for BL isn't just much worse well you have to have quite nerves for that or just by elimination you you get to that point so let's see what knight bd7 uh gives to Black okay so we well I have two questions to start with after Knight D7 first of all of course Knight D2 is an option but what about playing Rook C1 immediately it makes it things little different of course I don't know if if you want to go Bishop B3 is that your idea Knight D2 or your friends our friends idea uh Bishop C4 so takes takes E3 and then already B5 is possible because the Knight is not on B8 anymore so Knight B5 is not possible and also if Bishop G2 Black Goes Rook C8 right yep so this is a nice way of actually one tempo counts of course in many different different situations and this is one of them which makes actually black survive absolutely J I just want to quickly point out that Knight D5 is also possible because the Knight is already out from B8 so your idea from earlier might also be a nice attempt to try and equalize yeah actually I would I would like to keep my paone with B5 if it's possible or keep keep ding spone uh maybe it's over optimistic but uh yeah okay and at least here black has some ways of trying to defend and survive right so this is a good thing for black so I guess that means Judith that after Knight B D7 that this direct plan with Rook C1 it might be a little bit too fast and then Knight D2 is the alternative to keep that Bishop protect the pawn but then Rook G8 looks more enticing because G5 is available the Knight and Bishop don't team up on that square and he has found the best choice so Judith that was time very well spent by Dingle Ren he has played the best move Knight B to D7 so he's doing everything right the engine off the left of the board still says only slightly better for white I think we have to give credit where it's due that that was time put to good use dingly Ren has found the first step in the right direction yeah actually I would be very curious to understand until which point ding was in his home preparation or is he still in his home preparation wow you Ser saying that trying to work it out have you done that before Judah Because by the way you asked that question I feel like you've tricked many a foe into them believing that you were on your own but realistically you knew everything that you had to do unfortunately it was not the case my weakest point was always the opening preparation though I had the I can name two of my games also so there I played incredible ideas I don't even know how I did it I was very young in the first one when I played against hulak it was a chingan uh game and I made some tactical ideas that later on I got to some information some people said well she she's unable to do this I mean obviously it must be some home preparation which was not the case and there was my other game that one probably you know my game against Burkes and that was this uh amazing peace sacrifice and I played G4 a quiet move so I can open up the H file and on that one also few people thought including my opponent that obviously it had to be a home preparation but uh also I was I was not pretending when I was a kid I think I was pretending maybe in few occasions mostly at home with my sisters I don't remember a game but maybe also in a game when I sacrificed something something like like I blundered maybe so my my opponent would be capturing that and falling into the Trap well of course it's it's hard to imagine that dink knows everything and he spends so much time but uh sometimes it happens that uh you know that there are different Alternatives and then you have the time to decide I don't know but it also seems very strange if he doesn't know it and he ends up in move 13 in this position without uh without knowing the position because it is many times very hard to to sort out all the opport all the the lines here and and go on well whether it's a question of him just trying to remember some preparation he's done or whether he's on his own and he's proving that he's the dingly ran of old the one who ascended to the world championship title who has didn't lose a game for 100 tries I mean we know how good he is at his best and maybe he's just finding that form and he's finding the best continuations but John I think it's a good Mo moment to bring you back in because now gukesh for the first time all game is back on the clock we've looked through so many complicated variations but it seems like ding has found the right first attempt here and it's up to gukesh to continue mounting the pressure I think the best way to describe this Robert especially from my point of view is that it's easy to see these individual small ideas in the position once you explain Rook G8 to push G5 dislodging the bishop on F4 that makes sense once you talk about uh the Knight coming into D7 to remove the E5 Square from the bishop so that if you kick that Bishop it can't go to E5 that makes a lot of sense to me as well or if you say in response to Rook C1 at some point if the bishop takes on B3 my knight on uh D7 might then end up defending the C4 Square by hopping into B6 all of these ideas make sense in isolation where ding has my mind completely blown is that he's not he's stringing these ideas together and then more to come up with what chat correctly described as the tight rope of how we intersect all of these different ideas to form the correct continuation of the game so you can see these little ideas in isolation not connected together and what ding has just spent his time doing is really really incredible but that's only half the battle won right he's seen the first move in the continuation he now needs to not lose the threat and Robert from your experience that can be quite difficult to do in chess games sometimes although sometimes on the other hand it is important just to find that one critical decision and then after that you breathe that sigh of relief I'm not saying that that's going to be the case here but there are times for these best of the best players where they make that really difficult decision in a precarious moment and then they're like you know what my position isn't so bad they start believing in themselves more and are able to back up that first correct continuation with more and more so folks we've got gesh settling in for a think now but he has got plenty of time to do it an hour up on the clock compared to dingly Ren but that's a position he was

champion found Knight bd7 the start of a continuation that might be able to dig him out of the proverbial hole he's in at the moment some incredible opening preparation uh from gesh has put the world champion on the Rope a little bit out of the opening Judith after finding Knight bd7 it feels like we had not necessarily A transformation but certainly a shift in body language for both players talk us through what you think's happening well uh it things started to go slow in the opening and uh we had the feeling that Ding was caught in a home preparation by goes at the same time uh after ight D7 which was definitely the best move and then find it after spending lots of time and he's under one hour by now he started to play very fast by L talking Knight D2 and Rook G8 the idea is developing there so he can rescue his bishop and uh I have the feeling that things may shift to a different direction suddenly I don't feel that there are such a huge dangers for ding anymore and uh also before he went night BD seven when he was thinking for so long you could see that gkes was sitting there having his uh His Hands Across each other and then he was also a little bit meditating which is part of his uh uh routine I think during the game before the game and also during the game time to time we see him doing that re put himself focusing so much and being in the presence while ding's body language gave me the impression that he did not feel comfortable at all during that period of time while he was calculating the different alternatives for himself at the same time now already I feel that he kind of feels confident and and comfortable with his position so I'm very curious how the game and the body language what it shows to me because now I see ding as he's quite okay with with the position he has right now so Monumental shift in the body language there and the stat below I mean I think this is a fun one uh ding was down 52 minutes on move 14 in game number one he was playing with the black pieces as well and guess what he won that game he's now trailing by an hour and 2 minutes on move 13 playing with black I'm not sure how much we can read into that I do find that's a brilliant stat though what I will say is that Rook G8 was insta played he basically pre moved that on the board so all of that calculation he did previously is now potentially starting to come to fruition so Robert Judith I'm going to let you break that one down let's get back to the game thank you so much John and Jud we did see as John just mentioned an instant reply from dingly Ren and during that break we were talking about how suddenly dingly Ren seemed a little bit more confident gesh is the one spending his time he's on the clock so Judith now that you've seen the last couple moves unfold do you believe that dingly Ren was in his preparation all along and he's seen this before he was just trying to remember and not mix up those lines Point well you can never be sure this is what I can say because uh there are some part of the puzzle is missing for me either way how uh it happened the first uh 14 moves right now but um I mean I know for example with ivanchuk I mean he he might know that what he wants to play exactly and then he just spending time because he's enjoying uh looking at the position and getting under understanding it much better and understanding it so well that after that he can speed up his play and actually if we think about it we go back to game one uh it was a case where where ding really was thinking spending so much time he had a huge disad huge time the he was behind in time quite a bit and then from some point on he played maybe in six or seven minutes seven or eight moves in a row and they were not so easy at all but probably he was calculating ahead and this may happen in this position as well that he played Knight D7 after Knight E2 of course he played Rook G8 instantly and there is a good chance that he's going to be playing the next several moves also again very very fast and now it's gash's turn to figure out how he wants to continue the the game and this is where we we can see and I think I hope the audience also understands that that how things are shifting from one move to another but also how much in ahead the players sometimes think and uh it can happen with Aron Yan for example he was always very famous he was spending some time at some point in the opening maybe he had great preparation but still spending some time and then he was playing with very speed uh Speedy way the rest of the game maybe because he just simply understood the middle game where his pieces should be placed and and he knew the plan so I'm very curious how fast and well ding will be playing from here on this game I'm also curious I think the chat will be as well and I'm going to get the chat involved I want to hear your thoughts do you think dingly Ren was just remembering his preparation or is he just finding the best moves on his own so chat come on take a minute there let us know your thoughts hopefully we can get a poll up because I myself am curious I can't wait for the press conference after the game when maybe dingler Ren will share that yeah no worries I knew this one at home 6 months ago but you we see the question asked like we're talking about that will he start playing instantly now that he's invested the time Judith the good news for dingl Ren is that he has some clear plans we were talking about in some other positions white just had the easy play it was a struggle for black to come up with exact plans of his own we know that G5 is part of the plan and this bishop will have to slide back to uh somewhere the diagonal maybe G6 or H7 so my big question is know Rook C1 G5 if we start getting a little bit more direct in this position here what is actually going to happen over the next five or so moves because once you put a Pawn on G5 it does become a bit of a Target that white can go after well it is a big question whether is it going to be a pawn which white can go after or not first of all let's say white is uh White has several options of course Rook C1 is the move which uh one has to consider first it is very forcing because black is going to be playing G5 and uh at first it's clear that white can could take on G5 to take a pawn but then black captures it back and after Rook C2 the G4 Pawn is hanging so black is just simply equalizing great position maybe it's even nicer to play it with black so this is not an option for white so if you go back after Rook C1 the G5 intermediate move which is one of the nicest thing in chess I think uh why should be moving away his Bishop so where to move the bishop okay we can go to E3 let's say so to keep the the pointing over to the G5 square and now there is no question I think black has to go back all the way to H7 because if Bishop G6 then the G5 Pawn would be under attack so after black goes back to Bishop H7 the first question is can white go Knight F3 and attack immediately the G5 Pawn at the same time I think it's also kind of tricky if black can uh give up that pawn because after Bishop H6 does not seem uh very nice hly protecting the pawn um somehow I don't like my Bishop on H6 even though it's protecting that G5 no I don't know what to play with white but that doesn't seem to be right at the same time the question is what is right in this position for black because maybe Knight E4 is possible but then Knight takes E4 Bishop E4 Knight G5 so Bishop B4 is just a check and I don't see what else do I have in return for giving up the pawn I'm with you there doesn't look sufficient for full compensation white is upon pawn aead and I guess the question is this stage is to go back a few turns that once this Knight takes on e4 if I take back with the pawn and now I know you're going to go Knight takes G5 so this type of position I'm just very curious Jud did because I know you're you know you everyone we like our material but we also like to have some aggression and some chances I mean this Knight on G5 it can wrap itself back around Knight H3 Knight F4 but white is a pawn ahead black has I think some good coordination and can even castle queenside in the near future this Knight can jump out say Knight F6 and to D5 things like that would you say that black has good compensation or would you just prefer to have white and the extra Pawn I think black has not enough compensation and definitely I would take white but it goes together I guess yeah but you know some sometimes it's one of those like 5050 positions where like it looks pretty tempting to get this position because the activity but you're just saying that there's not quite enough activity from the black side I would think it's first though it is possible that black can be very concrete and play F6 e either white goes Knight H3 and then F6 or white goes something else and F6 and go Bishop F7 to immediately put attack on the B3 pawn and after that King C2 playing C5 or something so black would be definitely having some compensation but uh at first I would think it's uh it should not be enough but there is a question whether black does black really have to give up death bone that's a good one and I think it sort of highlights this inner struggle for players do I give up material for activity or do I keep material but maybe be a little bit more passive so you're saying uh if we go back in time here uh in this position if you Bishop E3 and say Bishop to H7 maybe there's a different bishop move but that looks like the most logical and but where can you go differently I'm sorry I think E4 if I want if I want to stop yeah the question uh the yeah this this is possible well this is a important uh important move to include indeed it's funny because on one hand Judith we don't really like giving up a bishop pair but on the other hand as we were just discussing we don't like giving up a pawn so this might be the best of a difficult situation well probably this is the alternative for black either to give up the bishop to go Bishop E4 and provoking F3 or to go back to H7 but in that case probably you have to give up a paone and how do you feel about this one let's say I just take the bishop because why not get myself the bishop pair and I assume you're taking with the Knight this type of position do you think white has some serious pull or has black done well to actually level up this game I think there is a good chance that black is just doing fine because white has the bishop pair but the position is pretty close for that that they don't have uh enough space of course if the white Bishop would be standing on F5 right now then it would be a different story but how the F1 Bishop will ever get to F5 right I mean there is uh not too much of a chance for it that that the white Bishop can get there because I can do it Jud watch see there's on F5 now I know these days there are many different kind of Chess played but I think this we will have to wait now this century when people decide that you go this way I thought you know I might as well use the powers that I have by picking up the bishop and putting it there but no your point is extremely well taken the light scor Bishop which is supposed to be an advantage right two Bishops Advantage they say not really getting an open diagonal to use at least not for the foreseeable future so I think sorry I it just came to my mind that it would be an interesting chess game if once in a game in the first let's say first 15 moves of the game each player can place its dream chess and one piece can be replaced to the dream square of the piece let's say so obviously in this position Bishop F5 right mhm but what would be Black's dream move ooh that's a really easy already good question um maybe Knight H4 something like that I knew you're going to say that but it's not as a big dream as Bishop on F5 maybe well it's funny that we're having this discussion because my coach uh you know he he passed but he uh wrote a book called dream moves and this was his concept always like what squares your pieces belong on how do we get them there and it's a very covian school of thought where you'd always see a carpov find that right square if his night was on C 3 maybe he'd back it up to B1 to then just reroute it somewhere else and so in these types of positions it's not just about the current state of affairs how can I actually improve whose position is easier to improve and this one I think it's actually just a toss of both sides would have chances in a position like this so I mean the game position still it's gukesh on the clock he's not sure whether to play Rook C1 if he can maybe include a move like G5 himself some all sorts of different possibilities that he needs to work through I believe he's out of his preparation and well while he's thinking and trying to figure out the best way forward just as we did with dingly Ren and talked about how he made it to this stage why don't we look at G's path to the FED World Championship at just 18 years old gukesh is Within Reach of history as he challenges dingen for the title of world chess champion born in shenai India gukesh is one of the most impressive prodigies the chess world has ever seen he became a Grandmaster at the young age of 12 years and 7 months had broken the 2700 barrier by the age of 16 he became the youngest ever to break 2750 his rapid rise toward the top has been nothing short of incredible an impressive performance and kukes is pulling out beating one of the strongest players in the world at the 20124 candidates tournament in Toronto gukesh entered as an underdog but soon he proved to be a real Contender after suffering a setback and losing from an excellent position to FIA in round seven the young Indian came back strong in the second half of the event by winning three games what a moment it isow gues damaraju the 17-year-old he is doing unheard of things while leading by half a point ahead of the final round the job wasn't done facing pre-tournament favorite hakaru Nakamura with the black pieces he needed to at least draw to secure a playoff while a win would secure a victory in the end gukesh easily held the draw and when kowana couldn't convert a winning position against npom Nishi the Indian Super Talent prevailed official congratulations to gesh the youngest player to win the candidates and to compete for a world championship title since winning the candidates the Indian teenager has continued to impress climbing to the top five in the world rankings now with the Chess World watching gukesh stands on the brink of History if he wins he will make history as the youngest ever Undisputed World chess champion and inspire a whole new generation of Chess Enthusiast I'm very excited to play the world championship and really looking forward to all the preparations and being [Music] there this world championship and now that he's here well he has tough sledding ahead but let's talk about gukesh damaraju he is the youngest candidate winner in chess history he was just 17 years old the youngest player ever to pass 2750 9 out of 10 in the recently concluded Olympiad where Team India won the gold and gukesh won Gold on the top board and if he does win this match against dingl Ren he takes that title and becomes the 18th world champion so Judith gukesh he's already so impressive and maybe The Best Is Yet To Come hopefully for him it is but he's nearly 2,800 he's playing on this stage what do you make of the player from India oh it's it was so exciting to follow him since uh 19 2019 I think that's when uh when I heard of him kind kind of more seriously and then um in 2020 online event uh I had experience with him because he was playing in my team in the CH Challengers chest stour and it was very interesting to see his mindset his approach his understanding his hunger to learn and build himself uh it was really a pleasure to to follow him and then I had the the privilege to to be around him seeing him uh in the Chen Olympia where he was playing incredible like like nobody could stop him until game nine actually there also it was uh it was uh not his opponent Abdus satov really but first he himself made such a big mistake instead of winning the game that he even lost the game so it it was very exceptional to follow him from round to round how he build up and how he goes there in every game and he stays focused and all these things and uh also in Hungary it was in my hometown in Budapest and he was uh playing here and practically killing everybody being so dedicated even in the last round when uh when they did not need the victory for India so he has all the the right approach and the character to become a v Champion I think one day so I'm not sure it's going to be this time but it can be and um we have some moves on the board yeah very mitto move G5 by him yes let's rewind a couple of moves have been played and as you said gesh he can become a world champion will it be in this match is a big question but that move G5 if we just back this up here we were talking about how Rook C1 inviting black to make that move but instead you know gash seeing that dingly Ren is aiming to play G5 himself he decides to push his Pawn there and that move is not the best choice it's not a blunder nothing of that sort but as we continue here it allows the Black Knight to step out to H5 so this move hits the bishop which drops back to H2 Jud at least to my eyes and I have four of them that it seems like black doesn't have nearly the same issues that we were talking about this bishop is going to survive it always has the F5 square and the Knight on H5 it may be sideline for now but later in the game that Knight can reroute via G7 to E6 or F5 so I have to be honest that this opening that we thought you know GES he caught ding by surprise there was this crnic versus aragi game perhaps knowing that you should be better but then not knowing how to actually obtain that Advantage sometimes encourages us to make moves like G5 like I need to press forward I just continue uh going up the board and trying to push my opponent back but Jud I do feel like the worst of blacks problems are behind him and even the evaluation bar if we can believe that it says black is to be slightly preferred now well we shouldn't believe it all the time right and we don't want to believe it all the time but I understand that it's there H yeah G5 was a very interesting decision and this is also so interesting and I want to highlight that no matter what kind of preparation you have like in some positions and in some character very Char characteristic positions even there there is always an option the decision to be made for example this is this was a kind of a critical moment I think for white that there do you play G5 yourself in order to push away the knight from the center so I stabilize my Bishop on H2 is very very safe and later on probably he has to plan to play F3 and E4 or E3 F3 King F2 develop with the pieces and then slowly trying to improve his position but it gives a very different structure suddenly or the other option was to play Rook C1 or to play something else allow black to play G5 so the big question was G5 G4 Pawn setup or G5 G6 and it has a completely different uh later on game because of that because of the pawn structure and if you have to decide it at the game it is it is very very difficult to decide because it is it goes by intuition and it's like very much you have to to have your strategy and you have to be Envision a long long long strategy in the game that is it going to be beneficial for me or more to the opponent was the the question is this F5 square is it going to give extra help for black and extra opportunities or no and we have games moves on the board and Rook h8 I really like because it's like he played Rook G8 when it was needed when it was the rescue the c2b Bishop the intermediate move so G5 is right then it's ready it was provoking white to be pushing G5 and after G5 it was very clear that The Rook on G8 is not doing anything anymore so actually dingl ran is not wasting time going back with his Bishop that okay thanks God I'm already free freed myself with the bishop and I go back to F5 no I'm standing on a C2 I'm going to be waiting until white is going Rook C1 and pushing me back so I still have time to improve and start to improve my pieces so actually the dream Square for The Rook is on h8 especially when he can move it his knight from H5 to G7 and then he's going to be controlling the H5 set H5 suddenly so in these last two three moves there was so many things have been changed in this position even though some people might think that well nothing special is going on it's like too three moves happened since the other one no there is a dramatic changes happened in this game in the last three four moves and Judi I completely agree with you and I don't want to overstate the case but I do like ding's position now I think it's easier to play and the long term I'm worried about these double isolated pawns if we do trade more pieces some of these end games will be quite difficult for white because black has a very healthy Pawn structure you have this Pawn chain from B7 up to D5 it looks safe and sound uh the open a file which is good for white if it can cause some problems black can always play this move A6 you know if you get enough time and I don't see how white increases any of the pressure so I see some plans for Black Knight G7 as we're talking about the bishop can always Retreat to F5 or maybe the Black Knight Will Gallop to that square but now my question for you Judi you mentioned F3 possibly as an option do you see GES going forward with like F3 and E4 or is you know you mentioned F3 and E3 as well if you're playing a little bit more solidly F3 step one but how do you see this game continuing and do share my sentiment that you like Black's position or do you still feel like gash has things in good control well actually I think big ding likes his position I think he agrees with you very much we have F3 on the board and uh well first of all black has no worries about any of his pieces anymore right so this is a big big big thing compared to four moves ago and uh yes all the things what you've said it's it is very valid that that now the double Pawn on B2 B3 it's it's it's something that white has to look after during the whole game right H I think V has to be active and um I would be just happy to be with the black side probably it's easier to play it with black side that that's uh that's the thing and it matters whether how easy it is to play it's also another thing which I think it's it's not on gash's favor that it's not very tactical and you cannot make it too Tactical for the moment it became very strategical situation now and placing to the best squares your pieces um I don't like the H2 Bishop after Rook h8 because at some point I will have to move it so I don't have a very nice nice Outpost for my Bishop at the same time also my other Bishop I'm not so happy uh yet I would love to have my Bishop on G4 then I would be very happy to play it with white but of course time moves matter like can white go replace and regroup his Bishop to G4 let's say starting with Bishop H3 which doesn't look very nice having your both of your Bishop on H2 and H3 on the H5 because I think black just moves away with his Knight to G7 and suddenly I'm going to I have to give up one of my Bishops to exchange it so I'm not sure white is in time to get uh the best placement for his pieces this is the biggest problem I have for white and dingly ren just returned to the board as you finished your thought there Judith you said that it feels easier to play for black dingly Ren he got up from his chair we know that he's actually been pretty much glued to it I mean in that first game of the match he didn't leave it for over 4 hours and I think it was the right time for him to stretch his legs if there ever was going to be one and you see that there uh right brought up just as I said at 4 hours and 7 minutes is the amount of time dingl Ren did not leave his chair that's an impressive determination I think my legs would fall asleep and I would just feel restless and have to get up but for dingly Ren the world champion for a reason he seems rejuvenated Judah and you see him looking at the position right now taking into account everything that we've been talking about the open H file looks very promising for Black Knight G7 rerouting this Knight you can do that at the moment hitting this bishop on H2 and one of the longer term issues that white has it's not even just the double I set of B pawns it's also this Pawn on G5 when you push your pawns forward they often become harder to protect and easier to attack so with a knight G 7 Knight E6 maneuver and a bishop E7 uh just simple development Jud we could see that G5 Pawn get under Fire quite quickly so I I know there's ton of life in this position and gukesh will have his chances to be active F3 hints at an E4 push at some point but I have to say that the static nature static element of this position I should say to my eyes definitely favor dingly Ren and it is no longer that tactical as you said Judith it feels like the technical phase is beginning and with dingly Ren's vast experience not losing a game in 100 straight contest and just the skill he shown over the years to Skyrocket over 2800 number two in the world for quite a while he might be thinking about this game Jud and saying wow the position I have right now this is one that he could only have dreamed of I'm not sure he was dreaming of this but I I guess he's happy with that at the same time after F3 it may become very concrete because actually if white if white would be on moved then E4 and the black C2 Bishop again we could say that it's in trouble I guess so now it's a question how black is reacting because for example if black would be going back to F5 with the bishop there is also not necessarily a good move or I'm not sure he the best because white goes immediately E4 and if black would be just going back to with the bishop on E6 then white would capture on D5 takes a knight B5 so suddenly things are getting concrete again because the KN C7 seems to be a very unpleasant uh move in in the next move so so now black has to think concretely again not only strategically how is he going to be replacing his pieces then there's another question black can think uh instead of going back with the bishop to go Bishop G7 for example immediately Counterattack on the D4 Pawn so what is white going to be doing is he going to play E3 or is he going to or or can he go anyway Rook C1 and E4 to be very aggressive and E4 oh we could get the type of position J it where there's now going to be a material imbalance is Bishop takes D4 possible at all like what happens here if you take on D4 giving up your bishop and I was wondering first about Bishop takes G1 but now that we're here and I can pause for a second can I also move my knight first to G7 to hit your Bishop on H2 with your Rook on G1 under attack as well or is that maybe like Rook G2 to save everything I think Rook G2 is possible of course black has some compensation great knight on F5 but I believe that white is still uh should be better there um so you see again immediately we got into some tech and some concrete lines but also what I want to say that after Bishop G7 even if you don't have very concrete lines in one hand it gives some extra for black developing move attacking on D4 but it takes away the opportunity for the Black Knight to go back to G7 so after all maybe you want to keep that space for the Knight or black can start with Knight G7 that's also possible Attack start attacking the bishop on H2 and asking questions where are you going to be moving or um I mean I think Rook G2 is not necessarily too good because already after that black can go Bishop F5 so Bishop H3 is uh is something uh which can be unpleasant for white I think agreed completely and so if you move your Bishop I think F4 doesn't make much sense because you invite knight6 with Tempo amongst other things if you go to G3 I'm wondering can black start going after this G5 Pawn I know E4 was one of those big ideas for white but I don't think you have time to get away with it just the G5 Pawn is loose and if we just you know try to go for the same plan with Rook C1 Bishop F5 and pawn to E4 I think you do have Bishop E6 and after e takes maybe bishop takes D5 because all these positions that you were correctly pointing out Knight B5 was really frustrating to deal with I'm just wondering this position yes white gets the two Bishops there is a bit of open space on this board but again the static weaknesses in this position uh there are many of them that white will have to deal with but the open C file could come in handy and a bishop B5 at the right moment it's actually quite a messy position yes indeed so after G5 there are suddenly many many many New Dimensions to the game because of this F5 Square ER and also that the bishop is not necessarily standing so stable on G3 if the pawn would be on G4 then the v b Bishop would be very comfortable on G3 right but now I feel that the bishop on H2 can can somehow be in a place where it doesn't feel so comfortable and so safe maybe F2 would be the best place place for the bishop I think to to cover some important H4 square and also defending the D4 and possibly after pushing pawns E4 it can be uh somewhat comfortable especially if the Knight is already moved back to G7 E6 or F5 I'm totally with you there Judy I just want to I mean go back before this move G5 from White I just you know the positions we were looking at which were super complicated not easy to work through but if you could give gukesh a takeback to get to this position where we were looking at something with Bishop E4 Bishop H7 this looks much more appealing I would think to the players and definitely to me than what we have in the game at least when you think about this from G's perspective so it does seem like he had a position that he wanted he prepared it he's following that chck game against Ari now that we're here it's like you know that was the analysis board on the the big board but if we get put the live position on the big board I mean black does have just so many more plans that were not available earlier an open file that black has control of some weaknesses on D4 and G5 Jud I know that there's plenty to go in this game and dingler ren he is down on the clock so he might have to make a flurry of moves without thinking too much to play them but he just I'm looking at this position and I'm wondering you know is gash going to be able to Buckle in strap that seat belt and say if I I need to calm the position down I'm going to do it just then or maybe he's relying on the notion that he should be better because it was his preparation and it doesn't really look like he's done much wrong and so it's not to say that black is anywhere you know even we won't even call it better it just feels a little bit more natural to play from the black side for me yes I also think that I mean black has more opportunities more opportunities and more ideas to choose from makes it also more difficult in some ways to play it because I think uh suddenly the compared to three moves ago now black is not the question how I rescue the Bishop from C2 but not the question is that I feel I have a good position I feel I improved compared to the last uh few moves what I had so now I have new aims my aim is how to optimize my pieces should I go back to F5 E6 should I be replacing my so now he has a dilemma of I feel that I have quite a few interesting ideas to choose from so there is a different problem for dink right now that he feels and of course we all feel that it's it's a complex game it's of course you you can say that you played with this color that color yeah there are more more weaknesses uh basically there are much more weaknesses for white right I mean uh and we can visualize it that if the Knight comes to F5 the H file also can be very beneficial for black and we didn't even talk about the Bishop from f8 where uh it can come to B4 where it stands very well also we were talking about having the bishop on Co G7 so black has much more plans at the moment white has one straight plan it's E4 can you do something in the center can you put pressure on black in the center but also after E4 the D4 Pawn can be vulnerable and the question is after E4 also what white wants because you just showed a line where if white captures on D5 it's also not so simple because uh I mean the that that pawn on G5 and G4 that's a huge huge uh different there ising too many squares were given away for white that's always the case when you push a pawn think about what squares you've just handed over to your opponent and we now see that dingl Ren he's on the clock he's considering his options John I know you've been eagerly watching the action here seeing how the last few moves have gone and now that we're here kukes healthy lead on the clock still dingl Ren's position improving but will he have enough time to work through future consequences and complications I mean just such an exciting round here in the third game of the match thank you very much Robert Judith it certainly is the world championship has not disappointed so far and my thoughts Echo basically what you just said where I know we were sort of in this position in round number one but we have what 23 moves to play and 35 minutes left on the clock and ding is still thinking I get that we can Blitz out some moves gesh played a move with 1 second left on the clock in game number one but at some point the time pressure is going to start telling so hopefully he'll have prepared the next sequence of moves fairly quickly otherwise we may see some more twists and turns in this game yet uh so very exciting for us watching online and for the people who are behind

what do you think the score will be you go first no I don't think it will be close but of course dink still makes his moves um and gash will be nervous but I think gash will win like plus three plus three or something so with couple games to go it will be over okay so you you don't think it's going in the distance no not full no no no no how many games it's 14 changing time it's been changed back to 14 14 yeah so I think first few games will be draw like let's say first three will be draw and then then gkes will actually you know gkes can lose also one of the games because he can he's a bit ambitious and it can happen but in general I feel like once he scores his first win he'll just get the momentum and then keep scoring so I don't know the final score but plus two plus three I don't know you also don't think it's going in the distance not a TI breaker no not no tiebreaker I think it will be decided in classical Chas okay what activity do you think you would beat gesin that's not chess like for sure like without even knowing anything that you just think your hands down the favorite over him wow for really this dancing obiously was mm same question coming to you so start thinking well I think anything else I don't know I don't know no no no but I'm I'm also not very good at like I I haven't played much any other games or um no Sports is not also something I'm much better than him I mean maybe okay table tennis maybe I don't know I'm okay table tennis I don't know how he is maybe if I have to pick sport then for sure badminton basketball two two sports where I know I'll beat him or anything which is like you know physical it requires physical strength wrestling wrestling wrestling I'm wrestling he just wants to be challenge just wants to beat up a little because wow nasty all right what activity do you think dingly Ren would be better than you wi besides chess probably some Chinese board game uh he must be very good at some kind of Chinese chess yeah some Chinese card game some okay back whatever they have these things yeah this back gam no different ones they have yes that's for sure yeah also he's way uh more knowledgeable on um poetry and music I think so anything uh any kind of Pop Quiz type thing trivia related yes yes it's crush me what do you think I don't know actually I don't know I mean if you don't think D can beat you at anything I mean if I'm given time to prepare then no like nothing no love that [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome back everybody to round three of the FED World Chess Championship we're about to get back into the action Knight G7 has been played on the chess board but before we do we are going to be checking out Mike Klein who's got a live interview with ashwat kaik who is the youngest ever player to beat a grandm over the board let's go ahead and check out what they had to say thanks guys we're here with kind of Singapore chess royalty 9-year-old ashwat and if that name means something to you it's because when he was 8 years old he became the youngest player ever to beat a grandm so aswa thanks for taking the time to talk with us thank you now you're coming up you're playing soon in the

2,000 at one point in your career you got to make the ceremonial first move in the first game what was that experience like I walked with ding and it was really nice and and he had to walk a bit fast because it's a world championship match the game one had to walk a bit fast to reach the Bo and ding is a tall guy does he also walk fast yeah okay but you kept up with him now tell us who are you rooting for in the match GES why is that because his style he plays really aggressive and I like aggressive okay well I don't know if GES is going to watch this interview but do you have some advice

here with one more very important question just in case Magnus Carlson is watching this interview you haven't had a chance to meet him yet tell us well tell Magnus whatever you'd want to say to him in case he's watching put down the golf clubs and come to the tournament right yeah all right well there you go the world's youngest ever player to beat a grandmas you did it I don't know like a decade before I was able to ashwat Kosik listen for that name Singapore chess on the rise this young man's On The Rise Magnus put down the golf clubs and come see us now back to you guys thank you very much Mike and thank you ashwa for that lovely interview uh Judith Robert I don't know about you guys but when someone is talking on camera and the phrase oh so at this point in your career you've achieved this and they're 9 years old it makes me feel like I've done absolutely nothing with my life uh absolutely amazing stuff uh really great interview and uh Judith you are fairly familiar with extraordinary achievements at a young age but that really is something yes it's a he's a very cute boy and it seems like he's very talented uh uh well I I was pretty good when uh when I was 9 years old but these days you just seeing lots of kids coming to into chess the they love the game they're playing online they're competing and they're just so hungry and passionate about the game which is lovely to see right well let's get back to the action because a fair amount has gone on Knight G7 was found uh during the break but we've had developments since then so Robert Judit this is getting pretty exciting back over to you thanks so much John and you know as we just saw the youngster was giving advice if it's an equal position don't over do it don't you know try to play for a win you can't be results oriented but this is too early to call any of that the last move played here Judah was a mistake from Dingle Ren we see the question mark and the only proper reply that gives white the upper hand is this move E4 F3 indicated that E4 would be next but I just want to backtrack a just one move here because Rook H5 is a question mark I just want to point out what a better move would have been from ding L Ren and in this position I do think that Bishop E7 just going right after this G5 Pawn that would have been a little bit more precise it stops this E4 plan because G5 would fall and the Knight would be under attack so you just force white to be a little bit careful here and the lines that we did look at Judah Rook C1 Bishop F5 and E4 you know white does get some activity But ultimately black does have a healthy position it's going to be a mixed bag chances for both sides but Jud in the game position Rook H5 played and now that blue arrow it appears E4 gives white an advantage yeah yeah I'm not surprised that the the game is is getting ups and downs as we see and of course it's not so easy at the board to get along and understand all these details especially when before the break we were discussing that uh at this point dink has and had a different uh challenge not to find the best move to rescue his Bishop but actually to find the best move from the different Alternatives because there are different tempting moves and in principle Rook H5 is a is a logical move immediately attacking the G5 pawn and also probably planning to bring the Knight to E6 to to attack even from more directions at the same time it might be the case that it becomes extremely critical and very concrete and after all we still have the bishop on C2 right at some point it may get in trouble still so we also discussed that E4 is the move of the position that's the only move that's the only key element of this position for white that's the only thing what white is playing for to gain some space and and break the center and push back the Bishop from C2 so the question is I mean obviously we should be looking E4 first Rook C1 also some thing to consider but then Bishop F5 and actually maybe also it can be a reason why ding might have uh played Rook H5 because after Rook H5 the black Bishop goes back to F5 also Bishop H3 is possible already because having The Rook on h8 then Rook H1 is a pin so this could be also kind of a plan for a later stage of course after E4 I think Bishop H3 is not the best because the D5 is hanging but just a general thought I wanted to share that the H5 Rook is protected so it can be sometimes very useful but uh well here I guess Bishop E6 would be the natural continuation defending everything on the D5 so the Central Center is uh very stable so maybe we go back and really observe E4 what uh What uh black can do against U the bishop trap so of course Rook G5 is the first one um to think of I guess just go for the bishop show no fear yeah the question is asking questions where is your Bishop going um I wish I had an answer I do feel it's rhetorical and I think it's trapped but maybe the bar is giving you this this sign that's why you think maybe there is something else right I don't see it exactly how to save this bishop yeah and it's interesting because in the live board to the right of us we see that it's actually kind of hovering in the middle so white is slightly better so we don't want to pretend like suddenly white is winning after Rook H5 but E4 trapping the bishop it's clear that Ding L Ren didn't just overlook this move he knew it was coming but he has something in store so Rook takes G5 it doesn't appear to work because of Rook C1 what other move candidates are there you could take on e4 I'm not sure I love the look of it at first but it's always a move we can throw in if we need and what else here Jud Knight E6 I think which comes to mind but uh I'm a bit worried for black if the position is opening up like after e takes D5 Knight D4 there's another idea to play Rook C1 but yeah after E Knight D4 uh I thought no maybe instead of Ed Rook C1 has to be played and after Knight D4 Bishop F2 that should be the first try to check aha so you're removing the guard by getting this Knight out the way so the bishop Falls what if I protect this Knight with like Bishop c yeah I thought of Knight A4 can that work ah Knight A4 going after the bishop looks so confusing to me this position I mean first of all how black already has one Pawn but now maybe Knight exactly what I was going to say so what Jude and I on the same wavelength about is Knight takes F3 check so you take a second Pawn give up your knight you trade Bishops on F2 and after King takes you just play Bishop takes E4 and black has three pawns for the sacrificed piece so Jud when you look at this position we see the evaluation bar is right in the middle so this material is uh a balance three pawns for a knight that's an equal trade but with with the evaluation bar being right in the middle which side would you take would you rather have the extra piece or the three pawns and the black side here well it's a good question I think it the position is pretty balanced but uh you have to be accurate I mean you can go wrong with either side very easily because what is Black's plan of course if black can bring his King to D6 King E7 King D6 I can bring my Rook on h8 or E8 some of the open files and I can and stay very active even exchanging on F3 and then bring my knight to E5 into the center black has a fantastic position I think it's much more difficult to play it with white I'm with you I mean the remaining pawns for black are healthy and defended the remaining pawns for white they're all still a bit loose in the position so I think that black would be stable here and feeling pretty good but I guess you know the position still has so many possibili is we we're talking about Knight A4 as one option right this Knight A4 move in this position but I guess there's something even better because it went from slightly better for white to just about level so tactics Galore at this stage and there's nobody better at least nobody I would prefer to look at them with than you Judit I mean Knight A4 definitely a good move candidate and a strong move is there something else somehow that gives white the upper hand well I think there are quite a few opportunities first of all well maybe just Bishop takes D4 takes and Rook G2 I mean the C2 Bishop I know that the the it's it's the protagonist of this game so far we talk about C2 Bishop nonstop oh but I hope for D that we can still talk about it you know it's funny Judith because I kind of thought I'm giving up my dark Square Bishop from the white side that has to be bad but I did forget the bishop is trapped nonetheless so this is very direct and why is it only slightly better for white because if that Bishop Falls and you only get two pawns rather than three shouldn't that lead to a real Advantage for gcash yeah that's a good question how black can uh continue to look for cter chances here maybe it's because White's pawns are just so bad like let's say we just give up our Bishop in this way take on B3 Knight takes D4 F4 the remaining pawns here are all isolated perhaps quite attackable and even your idea King E7 Rook h8 I mean this doesn't look like a position that's terrible for black but it's clear that white is the side for Choice exactly you would play play it for from the white side this is the only thing it's not winning for white but it's you who plays for the win small material advantage I mean the Knight on B3 does not stand too well that's uh that's true but still white is better for sure I mean this is just one of those positions where instead of three pawns you've only given up two so you you count the small wins here if you are GES so this means that dingl Ren he may not even at the end of this variation be in the worst shape but Judith it means that time has played a part because Rook H5 was played he um decided to bring the Rook up to attack this G5 Pawn but it he had a better position and now he's going to be the side that needs to prove that he can hold yes I'm very curious what dink has in mind what was uh he preparing against E4 and of course gash is very careful to try to understand that what is really going on he has a huge time Advantage for the moment he's spending uh already 11 minutes thinking what is really going on in this position but as we all know he's calculation is really superb so and I I don't really think that he has another move to choose from that's quite direct I mean the variation that you were just pointing out there on e4 has been played so it's dingly Ren on the back foot and look at that Knight E6 the only move for black that allows him to maintain the approximate balance slightly better for white we're just looking at some of the variations but he can't even throw in a pawn takes E4 which could be tempting in some position so dingl Ren he sits up he's looking at the position but Judith I mean we are on move 19 he has just over one minute per move to make does ding L Ren some of the forcing decisions will be good for him in the sense that it gets him closer to move 40 and gaining that additional time but he's going to be down a piece for just a couple pawns well what I see now that thing is really uncomfortable it's interesting that sometimes I have the feeling that it's so clear the body language uh they do I mean look at that in the last one minute it's like completely non-stop movement biing I think he just uh I don't know if he just completely underestimated the move or it was a blackout or what because I mean after this it seems to me that it's it is going to be some material down for things I really really do not like his position I mean this is I guess I don't fully understand what he missed exactly or what he was aiming for of course I'm not trying to criticize the world champion who's such a phenomenal player but just when it seemed like the worst was behind him he immediately left his Bishop on C2 to get trapped I mean it is in a vulnerable spot and has been and I think it's a bad side Judith when you make a move like Rook H5 it's me by the principled reply with E4 and then now you're back thinking because it shows that he wasn't fully expecting this maybe he underestimated it but his Bishop on2 is trapped I think he just simply blundered you know wow I you know normally I I would be hesitant to say that but looking at his reaction and considering that he's in trouble I would be inclined to agree with you you seem speechless Jud yeah yes because it's a very painful moment for black I mean until now it was uh interesting you can do this I mean Knight G7 was something that you can go Knight G7 you can go Bishop F5 you had the different alternative not so much but some alternatives and here again he had different Alternatives and somehow I think he played also pretty fast this uh move Rook H5 right or what how much was he thinking on that not much at all I he play that move incredibly quickly so there is some something uh happened here of course it's not going to be so easy I mean the line which we looked after Knight E6 there will be a fight but this C2 Bishop I don't see it can be rescued any anymore right and it's one of those moments in a chess game where we're not saying that okay dingly Ren just lost to toas none of that I mean this is going to be a fight and he will have very good chances to hold on but it went from him pressing for an advantage to him immediately being worse and sometimes these are the decisions in chess that Sting the most it's you know of course you never want to lose a game but when you just make a one move mistake that is uncharacteristic of the world champion I mean dingl Ren we know how strong he can be in the technical phase it was just a complete oversight like he forgot that his Bishop is now intuned in enemy territory it's going to be swarmed and one and the best he can do is gain two and if he's fortunate a third Pawn after the sequence starting with the blue arrow the only move and he makes a mistake here he took on e4 first Judith so it's not just one but a second mistake and what do you think he's aiming for by taking first on e4 well let's see if it's really a a mistake which followed the previous uh mistake he went F takes and Knight E6 okay so you know what it changes Judith in some of those lines with the Knight A4 idea from the white side there was Knight takes Pawn on exactly that pawn is no longer there so he's he's going to still dingl gain two pawns for his Bishop maybe in some variations he might even get a third if he's fortunate but it does feel like more of an open position which is good for the minor pieces and white will have an extra minor piece and black will have several pawns for it but what do you think about maybe after Rook C1 black is not taking on D4 but capturing Rook takes G5 and after Rook C2 to play Knight D4 with the tempo okay well let's bring up an analysis board so we can dive into the details cuz it is such a critical moment as evidenced by the blue arrow so Rook C1 you were saying give up the bishop with Rook Rook takes G5 M so C somehow you should be deleting this bar on the side you know it's discouraging oh now it's friendly was a bad move or what yes that has to be the C I mean that's so ridiculous right you're looking position maybe Knight F3 was the killer oh Knight F3 available to hit this rook and somehow no then Rook G3 and Bishop B3 no maybe I'm still okay the bishop survives because Knight D2 looks like it's good but then Knight takes D4 finally helps out this is just such a wild position and so okay so we're saying that Rook takes G5 no the problem is probably after Rook G5 sorry Bishop F2 sometimes simple chess is best simple chess is uh painful just just protect the Rook offer a trade protect the pawn on D4 the bishop isn't going anywhere and this is a very important lesson to everybody watching that I know it's tempting and I was tempted to just take a piece that was seemingly free but if the bishop is trapped and that's what we keep talking about the bishop is trapped you can actually spend a turn to make sure everything else is defended before getting that bishop and it's only going to be two pawns for that piece and Jude it's not enough here okay I'm keep trying okay so instead of Rook G5 I'm going to take Knight takes D4 okay so Rook C1 Knight C1 Knight takes D4 you go Bishop G F2 I go Bishop G7 not Bishop C5 what a great place on G7 simple defense you're saying okay so just to point out your point is if Bishop takes removing the guard this Rook on G1 is under attack so you do not have time to take this bishop on C2 and if the Rook moves we get our third Pawn for the Lost piece and this feels like a B3 exactly we get G5 and three pawns that feels like sufficient compensation yeah black is fine okay so there was I saw the bar before so I know that bishop4 was not correct but what alternative comes to mind here is it no well you can make a prophylactic move playing uh Rook G2 or Rook G3 but uh then I think Knight Bishop B3 and we are transposing exactly we transpose so I'm just cuz I know that there must be a weird tactic does Knight E2 I mean this is the most counterintuitive chess and I'm aided by the fact that the bar is very high in White's favor so I'm again removing the guard of this bishop on C2 what a weird and unorthodox way to play chess and I mean if this is the move that Ding missed it makes so much more sense now Knight E2 the only move apparently to keep white with the advantage this is a very nasty move you know that I me it's ridiculous very nasty because after night2 Bishop E2 and it's not only that my Bishop is trapped on C2 but you're even attacking my Rook at the same time so game is completely over right now I can't believe it Jud Knight E2 like undevelop if we just go before the capture here White's pieces they all look quite cramped over here and white is actually down upon PA for the time being and yet it's this trap Bishop that has been the problem it Remains the problem and it won't Remain the problem for long cuz it's actually just just going to be uh taken from this board so J well here of course still black will not resign even in such a position I would go Knight E6 back and captur the G5 but uh I understand that it's not the the fun part for black so let's try to fix it let's try to fix it how I think is the to move back question to move back until uh until the live position so here Rook C1 yes Rook C1 and I am taking on D4 but we don't have to if uh so if he checked G5 he checked Knight D4 yeah looks not ideal well I have a question for you Judith okay Knight D4 I'm not going to give up just like you taught me don't give up fight on so we talking about Bishop G7 there's this weird Knight E2 can I play Bishop C5 I know you're going to play Knight A4 I think is that where you're aiming or yes let's go Knight A4 because there is no more Pawn on F3 that was the third Pawn that black was getting but can I try to get tactical with Knight E5 to F3 get one of these Forks in here the problem is you can but after Knight C5 you're going to give that check takes takes King E2 takes takes and the C2 Bishop is still in trouble oh my goodness yeah Rook takes G5 Bishop B3 and now I'll give up my Rook for this Knight and what does this look like to you how many I have three pawns for a bishop does this look like a position where black could maybe hold or you just think that with the two Bishops and a rook there will be attacking chances that white can use well I think the big question is whether with my Rook from C1 can I reach to E7 or no um I can do that again remember earlier I show I can cheat for you here o yeah I don't like this at all I mean it's clear that white just plays for win with no risk yeah exactly exactly it's like either completely winning or just little winning but it should be winning it's just a little winning yeah it doesn't matter how winning we are as long as the job is done so I I'm in all seriousness though Judi if we go back to the live position we're talking about all these variations and in some of them uh black does get a third Pawn for the piece but still may not be enough I mean dingly Ren he has to rely on some kind of fortunate tactic from here on out and as we see the feature chat gukesh has a lot of time he will find it rookie won the only move that keeps white ahead in charge because what else really is there at this stage besides well Bishop F2 is also a sensible move move but probably after that Knight F4 and comes to D3 is that the problem yes good call by you just a and after Rook G3 Rook H1 oo and suddenly there are big problems for white now we're not talking about a trap Bishop on C2 we're talking about a king on E1 that's in the line of fire that doesn't look good well basically if you cannot if you don't see Knight E2 that's the only problem which can be for white like and I want clear it's a hard move to find Knight E2 is something we have the evaluation bar so it led me to think of what could it possibly be but I mean from a distance that's like a really really really difficult move to spot it is but if you play the world championship match and you want to be the world champion this is the least you should be doing to find night2 right I just want to show what we're talking about in this forcing sequence Knight takes E4 Bishop F2 get out of here Bishop G7 defending and Knight E2 I want to verify so I'm going to look and it is the only move yes every other move that you know white can play that's second third best is equal where we uh see this bishop on C2 is going to be captured but black gets a third Pawn but Knight E2 the only move that leads to a serious Advantage for white but whether or not it's a winning advantage that's the next question yeah it's um it's interesting that uh of course some of these ideas you may not find because you stop calculating so this is the question whether when gash is calculating Rook C1 Knight D4 Bishop F2 Bishop G7 obviously the first move he will calculate is Bishop takes D4 which we did also to capture capture The Rook moves away still the bishop is trapped but then it can sacrifice on B3 Bishop B3 so it's a long line of course gkes is calculating this no question about that and the question is whether is he starts calculating the other options instead of Rook C1 after Rook C1 Knight D4 or can he stop in every single moment and look for for New Alternatives because this is the only problem can be that after Bishop F2 Bishop G7 he just goes all the way and actually actually actually in game one we had a very interesting similarity to this because I I don't know how much you you remember you you of course you've seen the game but how much you can recall that there was a moment there uh it was two pawns up already for Ding and there was this moment when uh when uh gkes played Queen C2 and Bishop C5 was the most natural move so I think everybody not only top Grand masters Grand Masters Masters would play Bishop C5 instantly without uh thinking too much but he had this idea Queen takes G4 and there was a beautiful tactical idea which da just pointed out in a fraction of a second this queen H7 which of course gkes was also calculating and he found the reaction which I pointed out during the commentary Queen D4 deflecting the bishop and it does work out and actually there gkes made this mistake instead of making the bishop C5 which is the best move and it's the intuitively also the best move the only thing is that after that this sacrifice didn't work but he could play Rook F3 or Bishop Queen C2 where he could have a great compensation but because he just went all the way Bishop G5 Bishop C5 Queen H7 and this concrete line did not work he somehow did not look for something else in of this sacrifice but he went Queen C2 and actually that was the end of the game in a few moves for him so this is a question here if I pull a parallel that is he going to go calculating all the way Bishop D4 Bishop D4 uh Rook G2 Bishop B3 Bishop B3 what we just seen and then he says okay this line doesn't work or he's going to go for Knight E2 and Rook C1 is on the board but I have the feel sorry Jud sorry no I he might answer that question very soon because rookie want to clearly step one and interestingly ding hasn't responded yet so I feel like ding needs to speed up a bit not just because of the clock but I mean in terms of his chances here I mean the fact that he keeps slowing down after every turn I don't feel like he is uh particularly happy with the recent turn of events and how could he be he is going to be down a piece for two and maximum three Pawns so let me ask you the question if I ask you what do you think will be the outcome of this game think wins dros or goash wins well chat that was Judith asking you to get involved and let us know what you think is going to happen do you think that GES is going to win the game and even up the scoreboard or will ding L Ren hold on I'm of course not taking a win for ding into account because given the current Dynamics and that looks like not even a dream just it's a parallel universe not even parallel like a just you have to throw him into an alternate universe to win this game but I mean to answer your question Jud I think it really depends on how quickly ding plays the next couple turns more than anything like the moves will matter no doubt but he right now has 21 minutes and 30 seconds to make pretty much half of the moves of the time control and that means one minute per move Judith I mean you can easily easily slip in a position that quote unquote should be a hold and then lose on the spot because you do not have time to calculate and this will be difficult well I believe there can be equalizing the match before the free day seems most likely and goes on the clock now Bishop F2 I we have been going through these variations and Jud Bishop F2 played and I think here comes the critical moment will Bishop G7 be played Will Bishop C5 be played both moves protect that Knight on D4 and for gesh I think he will spot Knight to E2 because once you're in the live position and you're feeling good about your chances then you can spot it much more easily rather than several steps ahead well the big question is what is really the best move in defense for black right because of course you would play Bishop G7 so to give a little chance that you're opponent doesn't find Knight E2 which I think there is a very slim chance that kkash will not play Knight A2 he has to play Knight A2 I mean there is no way he will not find it I believe you and I believe in gh's calculation abilities he has paused for a moment but 92 I mean here it comes and if that 92 move is played and we see a retreat it's uh just you know one step back to make sure that you have a an advantage here to win the bishop on C2 jud's been the problem piece all day all game for ding L Ren and after Knight E2 that Bishop really is not getting out and black is just getting a couple pawns and has many problems in the resulting position well my question is of course that after night2 what will be the choice of uh ding how to continue I would think that he's going to go back to E6 and collect the D5 PA black has some very good stable sares in his position like the square E5 is very stable and and very comfy for his night the his pieces are going to be great the only problem is that one is missing I like the way you phrase that you have some great squares great pieces you just happen to be down a pretty important Bishop so uh you know some things go wrong sometimes small details I like your optimism because I feel quite pessimistic about ding's position but you know you have such experience playing uh the best players in the world and when you know you're worse as dingl Ren does right now he is going to be down a piece for a couple pawns do you feel like he believes that if he digs deep that he can survive this game or do you get the sense that maybe he feels like it's already past that point of no return if he thinks that he has no chance it doesn't matter whether he plays on or not he will lose the game if he believes a little bit that okay I'm fighting on I make the best moves probably I have little chance but I don't give up then at least he has some chance to to save the game so you have to believe in yourself and in your position that you're not sitting just there to to V your your time and just uh make more moves of course it happens when there is a very painful loss it can happen that you sit there you make moves and somehow you try to digest it so you collect your strength and energy to be able to resign to go to the press conference to reach your room because that seems to be a very long way from here on uh in some cases but uh he has to think of something how he's going to be still fighting on and still uh have some hope in it but of course uh it must be frustrated frustrated the the situation that actually he got uh so optimistic he got this chance after G5 that he had different options and and he just blundered basically he forgot about his C2 Bishop he thought after G5 he can get back any time and Knight E2 is on the board huge find from gash the Young youngster Trails by a point in this match it is early but this could help him even up the score he drinks water he that's how you know he's feeling good about his position and now it's up to dingly Ren to find some quick moves in succession to give himself hopes of surviving because he is down to 20 minutes he needs to reach move 40 to gain some time on the clock but you know he's in trouble on the board on the clock and Judith the match has been going his way thus far but this third game definitely not at the moment not exactly indeed this is not the right moment to ask how ding is doing in this game um and of course uh I have the feeling that Knight E2 is the move which was blundered by him Knight B3 okay it looks like that Knight takes B3 was just as good as some of the other options where you are only getting two pawns for your lost piece and you see gesh there from the vantage point of a piece now it's dingly Ren's turn and he snaps that Knight off the board Knight takes D2 so as we see some trades happen the good news for ding is quick moves he's getting close to the time control the bad news he's down a piece and I have to ask you Judith we see the chat 57% the the number is growing for people believing in gk's chances to win in game three when you look at this position objectively speaking do you feel like black has some decent chances to survive here or do you feel like you know just huge trouble and in all likelihood gukesh is just going to win gukesh has to win this is the the story I think if he wants to become a world champion he has to win this game he can't that's B statement yeah because you don't have so many chances to collect points and this is too much of an opportunity to not to not to win I mean it's a huge thing if if ding saves this game I think definitely he increases uh much more his chances that he's going to be defending his title I know it's only game three I know but that's how I feel that gash has to equalize the match right now from this position I love a bold statement and in all honesty it may not be that sort of out of line to say that because for gukesh this is his second game with the white pieces if he fails to win this Advantage where objectively speaking it is not winning there will be plenty of chances left for dingly Ren to fight on you see the evaluation bar to the left of the board it is significantly better for white but still there is a lot left to prove for gash who only is three pawns remaining it's two pawns for a light Square Bishop that's the material imbalance ding the ren in trouble I mean this position it just seems like one where uh for ding he needs to find a plan and I guess Judith you know you're usually great at that I see some moves like Knight E5 Rook H2 attacking a bishop but that doesn't really get me anywhere I mean what's an actual plan for D well he has great pieces as we discussed so he's going to put I think Knight to E5 maybe he's even going to be long Castle um and the it's true I think that white will need good uh technique now there will be a huge question where gkes is going to me be moving away his King because I think on E3 is not the best Square because somehow it blocks the bishop on F2 and also it can get vulnerable Knight on E5 is check on G4 check on C4 long Castle Rook D3 check I don't know something even F6 and then Bishop H6 I don't know there are a lot of tactics so somehow I have the feeling that uh maybe the best way to go actually it's not so easy to go away with the King no it's not I mean white pieces are a bit clumsy right the Knight on E2 blocks in that Bishop on F1 maybe he has to go Knight D4 to stop the I mean has to be very accurate I believe in this position well actually wait a second if Knight D4 and if I just bring my Rook I I want to pin this Knight because I feel like there will be some tactics available if you can maybe bring up an analysis board I do think it's a such a critical moment of this game because while gukesh has the upper hand one mistake here could immediately throw away the sizable Advantage he's built up so yeah I mean it's just a position a crazy I have a crazy idea very crazy move Rook C3 Rook C3 huh just covering the F3 square and the D3 and I I make space for my king on C2 and also I can go Rook H3 to exchange the Rooks if I want oh that's a tricky one okay I'm going to pull a DA here but it might not work does Rook takes G5 work oh my god oh I see the bar going up oh only a teeny bit so you take back Bishop H6 because Bishop E3 I then have this Knight F3 check and Bishop H4 F6 I know I'm never supposed to play it but it does win me this Rook back and okay King third PA you seem totally unimpressed and it's like really making me uh feel nervous about the position but when you have a piece up you you tend to have a a better blood pressure yeah I'm not saying my blood pressure uh and no wrinkles and no anything somehow you feel good and strong Rook C5 yeah how did I get the black side of this why am I the one who has to defend a piece down you know Jud I'm a I'm a kind person but somehow I feel like I've been too kind to let you get the white pieces here it's simply um a piece up for three pawns though and I I want to point out that the the evaluation bar is still not that high so it does seem like black will have chances to survive but it will be a difficult task yeah maybe I should do something better than this actually okay so uh Rook C3 I G5 yeah I liked I think it's no it's so but what else do I play instead of I was so happy with Rook C3 King C2 to to go away with my king well now I feel like I should apologize because you know I didn't mean to take away that that plan it still clearly was a favorable position for white so Knight D4 was another move I remember you yes Knight D4 and I wanted to play Rook d8 let's go for the pin and then maybe King uh King C1 just run away do I have Rook takes G5 again though because your pieces are all loose everywhere yes yeah yeah it's actually not so easy to consolidate my pieces right now yeah what a tricky position because I think if we blend ideas together just to go back here I'm not even sure that the king D2 was the best move was it King D2 uh let's see so Rook Knight T2 so Rook takes D2 of course the alternative uh still slightly better for white but I guess Knight E5 Now is really annoying yes because Rook G3 Knight C4 possibly okay so let's go back to the game because it's very exciting can I can I make safety for my king how is the question we want the answer to um yeah Knight D4 Rook d8 I still feel like this is annoying for white to deal with but the evaluation bar seems completely unbothered well maybe King E1 maybe King E1 is the with then Rook D4 is a problem yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah takes and Knight F3 I mean there's so many tactics here but King C1 did not work because of Rook G5 right I think Rook G5 looked pretty good just uh takes and again I think white is obviously better here if we just go through the uh the variation something like this Rook takes D4 black does have three pawns for the bishop and I'm now wondering oh no that that doesn't work because you can't take with the king at the end and Knight F3 check again with a fork uh but this has to be good for white you have a bishop yes but here I see great chances to make a draw for ding to save the game yeah that is uh the if you're thinking about this from G's perspective winning chances this doesn't seem like the best chance to go for wins so I know Judit we were talking about King E3 you mentioned that move as a possibility I mean is it I well maybe look risky yeah it looks very risky it looks the most natural move at first but I don't know I'm a bit worried about different opportunities for black can I do can I do Rook takes G5 again is that just for a change can I just uh revisit our old friend with Bishop H6 go go go try it takes Rook G5 takes Bishop H6 Bishop H4 F6 mhm this position's annoying honestly yeah unexpected it's sort of have like the look should just be great for white but at every single turn along the way I don't want to have my king on E3 what does it do there so how do you get it not on E3 I guess is the it's a very interesting moment of the game and also psychologically you know that because things were happening pretty fast the last uh six I mean since ding made the blunder Rook H5 things have speeding up and also I think it's not so easy to adjust yourself because of course go should have this that oh my God I have a piece piece up right of course it's not so easy it's very clear but I have the advantage I I have the lead in this game so I have the opportunity now it really all depends on me it's not a bad thing anymore I mean if I play really the best moves then uh I should be able to convert it into victory so now there is extra pressure he created the winning opportunity but now it's only him who has to just make the best moves I just really like how you frame that though Judith where you know often in a game of chess it's just you versus your opponent you look at the board you figure out the best path forward and if you make a mistake it's entirely uh your responsibility and thus your fault but here as you're saying it feels like a position and we see the evaluation it is quite quite heavily in White's favor that it might not even matter how ding replies if gukesh turn after turn he turns out the best move but that's easier said than done it's good for GES that he has over 45 minutes he is deep in thought but we just showed a series of variations where there's a check here a fork there a pin as well it's not easy to find the winning path for gesh and we are at that point where uh it's near objectively winning for gcash if he finds every single best move but Judith I mean this position still has many tricks left in store I have a new idea Knight F4 aha Knight F4 Judith says okay so you're allowing me a oh my Rook on H5 is hanging I thought I was just you know forking your uh King and Rook with Knight F3 check you're welcome to do that yeah I see what you mm take this and then we see a trade of pieces and this is clearly bad for black with an even worse Pawn structure okay so the simple Fork is misleading Knight F4 let's say I do Rook takes G5 I think that's what you have to do yeah Rook takes G5 Rook takes G5 Knight F3 check King E3 Knight G5 but at least your knight is very badly placed or much worse than it was on E5 at the same time black has three pawns right yes these three h Rook C5 okay Bishop H6 and that looks spicy I get why you didn't like the King on E3 Judith I I hate the King on E3 you know and I'm forced to have my king on E3 all the time so Rook C5 I don't do because I just provoke a great move by you maybe I should get back my knight eventually to D3 but my E4 Pawn is hanging also very frustrating no not yet not yet because after Knight D3 you just go Rook d8 I believe ah okay just simply uh continue to improve the location of the pieces that makes sense it little bit worries me with why that I don't have enough bones left so let's see D4 he has played Knight D4 so I think we can anticipate a swift Rook d8 I don't really see another tempting move at the moment but that is at least none more appealing than Rook to d8 and then the question is Judit King E3 is what we've been talking about King C1 we've been talking about is there just King E2 I know you didn't want your King on E3 and I think now that we're here I'm like wait a second there was a knight on E2 it's gone maybe King E2 but hold on for black there is a a big question you go Rook d8 or you go long Castle I want to play Rook d8 for some reason I'm afraid of Castle maybe it's because we're approaching a possible end game and the king in the center might be where it belongs but of course cast and queens side is a very reasonable option as well somehow I also have the feeling that Rook d8 is a better choice because somehow when the king is on C8 at some point Bishop H3 check might be an important or beneficial for or white I'm with you and so I thought ding was about to move but he kind of reached out and then paused again and Judith look at the clock as well down to under 17 1 12 minutes for dingly Ren and we're only on move 26 so this position is going to remain quite challenging for him and he really will not have sufficient time to work through any of these really difficult decisions he has to play fast at the same time if he's not making the best moves he may be just losing the opportunity to to pose the biggest uh difficulty to gash and wow we see the king2 is the only move that keeps white with the huge Advantage we saw a number of variations where white was still better so it's not like uh with a different move like King to C1 that white will still be the side for choice but Jud it only move to keep this big Advantage with I don't know we we struggled to come up with it and Rook H2 then becomes tempting in some positions I would say these moves are actually trickier than initially met the eye but King E2 again is a very logical move because somehow I mean you have the feeling I think I have the feeling that the king well that's why I wanted to go Rook C3 also somehow it stands better on a v Square to start with somehow it's I mean because not only that it's on a v square but not to give any opportunity for the E5 Knight to jump to F3 to G4 to C4 to D3 I mean uh all these things so King E2 will be played and gash did find the first necessary move on E2 with a knight dropping back about three moves ago and now he needs to bring his King to that square and I feel like it's one of these positions where kingy Tu makes a lot of sense we've just worked through some of the Alternatives but there's still at least in the back of your mind you think all right there could be some pitfalls but he finds it of course he does course he does with the exception of G5 by him where that was a mistake he pushed his Pawn freed up some squares for Black's pieces yes if you could take that move out of the equation he has played an exceptional game yes no King E2 is a very powerful move but it was not so difficult even if you do it by elimination you get to there because there was no other real option right I mean Bishop E2 was the only sensible but then Rook H2 so you have to go out from the the defile so so now the question what to do with black and once again I don't have an answer to that one I'm going to be honest with you because I mean does black sit and wait would that be your strategy you know just put all your pieces on defended squares A6 and just try to pass the turn or is there a way for black to be a little bit more active well being active is a good thing but I don't know how he can optimize his uh pieces because it's all stands in the best place of course the bishop would be coming to F4 that would be a nice move continuing dreaming for black but uh it's not moving there and the king is really very safe on on E2 so black can also not push B6 C5 that would be something I would go for to push away the knight from D4 and control the dile and possibly some important Square for the Knight on D3 but uh I don't see that the question is for example to me if Black Goes Rook H2 of course that seems to be the most active move but then the question of after Rook H2 Rook G2 who does it favor ah but actually hold on maybe that is a possibility for black Rook H2 and if Rook G2 then takes takes and Knight G4 nice find by you that if the trade happens the Knight gets out to G4 and opposite colored Bishops at least the thought of them should make black feel better about the ability to hold this game well it's a question whether is there any reality to save the game let's say Knight F3 and then let's say black takes the bishop King F2 and I think White's plan would be to block the bishop by playing E5 but this is something that not holdable for black I believe E5 Rook E2 Bishop H3 and uh it's it's completely over so so this is not an option for black so unfortunate because it at least from a distance in my head it was like okay uh this Pawn on B2 possible issue but as you're saying like E5 Rook E2 E6 at some point and the presence of those G pawns that hurts black because the more pawns that remain that means that white can try to win it and then get a pass Pawn uh on that side so we see that a move hasn't played Rook H2 Judi you called it it's been played uh on the L board and you know after Rook G2 I think black would be playing Rook H3 what do you think to keep the Rook under I think that makes perfect sense and now Knight D3 becomes a annoying threat and yeah you have a really good point that the bishop on F1 it hasn't played its part in this game it's just been sitting here hasn't moved hasn't moved once right no that's sitting there wait for giving a role to them to it uh well how do you give a role to it I think it actually just kind of looks it has some ideas one day it comes to the C4 let's say or H3 just to give a little support and push to the other pieces and I'll I'll do the dream move thing I'll put the bishop on A2 right and just stare at the into the position but in all seriousness Judith you know we talked about some Rook C3 ideas at some moment and often times for everybody you know watching and trying to learn from this trading is good but you have to look what happens when you trade what's the transformation and here what I don't like Judith is while white is still better the Knight on D4 gains a protector I don't like giving an outside pass Pawn like that would at least force me to pause before I made a decision like this because uh A5 A4 B5 these type of moves they happen really quickly yes it's true but it seems also that the pawns are pretty far distance away from any action which can bother white I believe we have Bishop G2 look at that oh so your knight G4 idea ah but then Knight F3 no just kicking that Rook out of H2 and then the bishop can actually even think about taking a Pawn on A7 nice nice move indeed yeah dude it felt like a bishop G2 is like getting in the way but we talked about how the bishop had yet to move it makes its first uh kind of presence in the position and Knight G4 if that's not available what else does black possibly have here I always have something so I go Rook H5 okay Rook H5 uh Knight F3 I think looks good knight d E3 ah okay you want to take my bishop or go Knight F4 so I slide away Bishop E3 and and you don't care about now of course Knight on F3 stands incredibly well yeah yeah I mean it's easy to say now that gcash played it but I really like Bishop G2 now that it's appeared here yeah because the H2 Rook now is kind of excluded from the action well well well it's getting very hard for ding in every direction on the board on the clock can I ask you a question Judith if black passed the turn to White what is gash's next move is it Knight F3 or is there something else that's a good question well I can imagine that white can also play B3 or even B4 B5 so what you're really saying is that white is completely spoiled for choice and black is having difficulty finding even individual moves but we'll see because A6 was played sit and wait it was the same question from ding [Laughter] he he just put it in the Practical form of it yeah you know they say actions speak louder than words so his uh question was dealt with an action rather than spoken aloud and well okay Knight of three is available and once these Knights get traded the question becomes what further trades do you want so this is maybe a difficult thing for our audience to visualize in their heads but I am going to ask the question anyway because it is essential to understanding the truth of this position what trades does white want so you know Knight F3 is a knight trade does white want the dark squ Bishops off how many Rooks do you want traded so Judith what's your like kind of initial read on what pieces white might want to remain on the board it's a very good question Robert very very good question how to win a huge advantage and how to convert it and this is the the first question we should ask of ourselves that how to simplify the position to improve the chances of really converting into Victory uh Knight F3 has its points completely at the same time I'm not sure it's necessarily the the best way because I don't know how to optimize my uh Rook because somehow the best thing would be with Y to play Bishop on G3 F4 somehow that's what I would be thinking and maybe even to take on E5 and Knight F3 and E5 this this is the idea we had before right so that would really increase the uh optimize defens for white if Knight F3 then Knight takes F3 I think white would be capturing with the King yep I'll bring up an analysis board to show that Knight F3 Knight takes and you don't want to walk into a pin so you're saying King takes F3 yeah Bishop F3 is also possible but I'm not sure it's so good for white to to to allow that to to simplify and exchange I mean even black can go Rook F2 takes Bishop D4 but it should be losing of course I okay you answer the question I was this is a great moment to pause and say these trades you think allows white to just have a winning position now yes but it of course because Black's King is very much behind if let's say we talk about dream moves if black would go King F4 then of course it would be a different story right so it does matter in what circumstances we can simplify the position I'm with you there okay so all of these trades is not what ding wants I got if let's say in this position to finish the calculation and understanding if white king reaches to F4 then it's just a complete living position and you will win right because there is not going to be such a big deal for black it's you will win in one way or another all these pawns are in light squares which is very bad for black right these pawns will be so now you get an answer what the bishop will be used for to collect yes and actually the pawn on G5 which we criticized earlier is very helpful because it keeps the F7 Pawn stuck in place okay so I buy that so you're saying that these trades are good for white so that means ding will not be so friendly even though he's a nice guy that he's not excuse me after Bishop takes F3 he's not going to take on F2 with the Rook so how do you sort of play on for black if you don't trade all these pieces well you could be more fair to me and give a better position with [Laughter] black I apologize it wasn't me it was ding I I'm sorry yeah so I I don't know the problem is that black cannot stabilize himself it's like even if black puts the bishop on E5 V will be going Bishop G2 block The Rook again I think and somehow push Rook C5 and kick away the it's very important to to move away the E5 Bishop in one way or another yeah you need to sort of boot the bishop out of there gain some space but I think kind of what what we're getting to is that it should maybe be winning for white but it's not actually going to be that easy like there will still be some obstacles in gk's way I think these having only the Bishops it it it it is not so easy for white to to win like this one so let's see if instead of Knight F3 there is a better way uh to do it so it's a big question for me for example whether B4 favors white or black of course for white it would be for example very nice if he could regroup his Knight to C5 but for now if Knight B3 then Knight D3 kind of thing happens and it's it's not so nice maybe though I would want to play Bishop G3 very much and for that I would need to move away my knight yeah but where to except for Knight to F3 I guess there is an opportunity at some moment to venture this way up the board but then the D3 Square as we're talking about so Judith I mean this feels like one of those moments in world championship history where GES on the cusp but still has so much left to prove and you know when you're facing a world champion like ding L Ren he is going to give every last ounce of effort to fight here so w gukesh he's on the clock John I know I mean you've been taking all of this in it's gesh on the clock now he's way ahead on time he's up a piece for just a couple pawns what do you making of all this Mr Sergeant it's a lot to take in Robert and not only that but uh the evaluation of the position only really tells us part of the story you could be watching this thinking well gkes has done the hard work now because the eval bar is strongly in White's favor everything's looking great but the reality is uh getting into a winning position and then winning the game from that position uh many chess players will say they're two very different things so the Rober at what point do does gukesh start to think differently at what point can he start transitioning away from what is objectively the next best move in the position to to something else can he even let the foot off the gas a tiny bit I don't believe you can take anything for granted at this stage because for gukesh I mean he's the one who surprised his opponent in the opening and then immediately he was the one who made an error with that G5 Pawn push and now he's here he knows that he has the upper hand but whether he has that knockout to deliver is a totally different question and dingly ren he is tough gukesh has expected his best on this world championship stage and if dingl Ren brings his best to this moment he will make gash's life difficult that doesn't mean that he necessarily will save it but he think Len is facing the problems on the board and on the clock and he's also facing an opponent who is just as determined as ever so folks uh a piece down but with some pawns for compensation world champion dingly Ren under tremendous pressure with goes nearly three times the amount of time on the clock we're going for the briefest of breaks here so top up your drink it's possible the conclusion to this game will happen when we come back [Music] [Music] this is the Google pixel 9 with Gemini and this is Dan suggesting some places to meet up and watch the game tonight but you know what's better than a list of places knowing how close those places are which is why you're just going to ask Gemini to put these places on a map whoa how's that for [Music] teamwork are you happy with Singapore as the venue yeah I was uh I was happy to play Anywhere But uh yeah

additional moves played this could be the beginning of the end for this game for ding ler Ren Robert hes Judith pogar back to you to take us through what's been played on the board thank you so much John and in all honesty just a couple of moves have been played we still have the same outline of the position white pushed the pawn one square to B3 Judith was pondering you know where that pawn belonged and ding play the move Rook to D7 a very quiet move but he makes sure that every single Pawn of his is protected the B7 Pawn preemptively defended just in case and also just passing the turn back to his young opponent so Judith we've been discussing many important questions of what pieces should be traded what's gash's winning plan it seems like dingly Ren he's sort of answering the question on his end of I'm just going to play sit and wait and you have to prove that you are going to find some kind of uh way in because I'm not just going to throw pieces for and allow you to attack me absolutely and um I have to say it's not going to be easy for gash to convert his Advantage because uh ding seems to be he's Rock Solid here uh he has two pawns for the piece but all his pieces are extremely active so the H2 Rook the D7 Rook optim optimally plays Knight on E5 of course it's a incredible spot for the Knight and the G7 Bishop also just supports uh everything and optionally when the Knight can jump away to G4 or somewhere then the the bishop can be also very powerful so now it's gkes who will spend time and he has significantly much more time than his opponent but now he has the task that he knows that he has the advantage he knows that it should be an advantage that it's possible to convert it into Victory but it's not a position where it's going to be calculation only that I go here he goes there and then I'm just forced I calculate the lines and and then it will be Force win no you will have to maneuver you have to exhaust your opponent a little bit you have to make strategic decisions which piece to exchange which we were discussing with what circumstances it's possible to do to be honest in the break I was thinking about the fact that Bishop G2 was the best move when uh black played Rook H2 and not uh to play Rook G2 because right now the G1 Rook is very much tied down to the bishop on G2 so now white can say that uh he has a piece up he has material up but his pieces are not optimally placed and this is the big question how to replace the pieces Beast re was played which I think was uh pretty sensible to to take out from possible B2 when the bishop can capture it and also I think it's an important Square for uh the pawn to cover the C4 Square so if let's say one day white wants to go Rook D2 then uh then uh C5 comes and I think also that Rook D7 is a very smart move because it's kind of a prophylactic move if white would be if White had the plan to play Rook D2 it is not possible to play that anymore because then black can go C5 and uh and white cannot go Knight F3 for example because Black Goes Knight F3 and after Rook D7 which is not with a check because if the Rook would be on the then it would be a check and white would be capturing back the the piece but black can go Knight F3 and Rook D7 Knight G1 would change change everything so there are some nuances which is happening right here and uh it is very important for black to make all these moves that to play against White's plans because uh V doesn't have enough Square for his pieces if you look at it if we go back and the actual position what is standing on the board where gashi is spending his time basically V has no Square in the territory of black side because all the pawns are covering G6 Pawn is exceptionally well placed covering the F5 Square the other two pawns on A6 C6 they are also doing very fine so it is going to be not easy to crack Black's defense and I like what you just pointed out because I want to show that one more time that in the event of Rook like if instead of Rook D7 I just want to put the um somehow get to the position how do I do this uh yeah here so if this were the position set the Rook was on d8 instead of D7 and C5 were played I really like what you pointed out the Knight F3 and after Knight takes F3 Rook d8 is with check so that Rook D7 move as you called it prophylactic because it gives black additional options and actually stops white from trying to trade off all these pieces and get a check along the way so really instructive from you there Judith um Rook D2 not a good move anymore because of C5 and if that's the case I mean it it's kind of difficult to come up with ideas because Knight F3 is something that we kept discussing but here it's actually a mistake I believe because Knight F3 Knight sorry after Rook D7 as in the game Knight F3 once you take if you play Bishop F3 we get this exact position that we saw earlier but there's a critical difference the pawn is on B3 and that's bad in this particular line because Rook D3 hits both bishop and B3 Pawn at the same time so while it takes away the C4 square and gets off the dark Square Bishop's diagonal in the live position it does have this really big downside that it actually can get into the path of the black rook in the event of a bunch of Trades so Judith we can say we like certain parts of it but anytime you push a pawn you have to see the drawbacks and here it's that the pawn is on an undefended square if the Knight on D4 disappears so I really have to sort of uh continue to amend my thought process of like okay it looks really good for white very promising which it still does I should be pressing forward and now I'm like actually how do I accomplish that so maybe it requires a slower approach and not just trying to trade all the pieces right away well that is a very nice Point Robert that after B3 there are new ideas which we have to take in account that the B3 actually can be vulnerable after the Knight is moved from D4 now I'm wondering if uh can white go Rook C5 maybe to provoke black a little bit or the provocation turns out to be too good and you really play B6 and C5 and I get in trouble although you might have Rook takes E5 ideas exactly I think that's that's what I would be doing taking a knight F3 Aha and get a fork there so at best black is going to give back that Rook for the minor piece and uh and how great that the the rookies on D7 so after Rook H5 I can go Knight E5 but okay anyway we would have three pieces yeah it's not only that it's attacked but in every way it's a problem for black so what about C5 yeah I was going to ask you just mention Rook H5 now after Rook C5 can you start with Rook H5 and go after this loose Pawn here we have a move Rook C1 okay Rook back to C1 connecting the Rooks he wants to go D1 I guess ah so that way the Rook is on a more protected square and none of these sort of checking variations that we looked at before four okay where does that leave us Judah what other moves do we have for black because I feel like we've just been passing time in a way well the question is whether is Rook cd1 is it a real threat and after that uh the Knight can move so what should be black trying to do against it right that's that's the big question is at some point Rook E7 might be interesting you know with the idea moving away the Knight and then the E4 Pawn can be attacked so Knight F3 is not so easily played very true and actually with the Rook on C1 Knight F3 now is an option because the Rook on C1 protects the Rook on G1 so it's not just a a rinse and repeat if I may just bring up an analysis board quickly because I know dingler Ren he's dropped under 7 minutes and he has 10 moves to make but in this position if we get here that all these variations with Rook F2 and Bishop D4 check the king can actually go to the center now because after Bishop takes G1 Rook takes back and the King covers the D3 Square so no entry point for the black Rook absolutely correct so actually after Rook E7 probably you can go anyway Knight F3 King e he does bring yeah King up and 6 minutes 32 seconds for dingly Ren he just made his 30th move here and now the question is Knight F3 is that a good move just trading pieces we keep talking about that any other moves come to mind in addition of Rook cd1 or Knight F3 do you have maybe a third candidate or maybe even a fourth candidate move well I I think those are the two most logical continuation Rook C D1 and Knight f three the big question for me whether is Rook C D1 is the the better option though after King E7 sometimes one day Bishop C5 check can come in the right moment so I'm not uh I don't think the king is standing better on E7 than on E8 but black had to make a move right I agree with all these pieces on the board King on E7 is worse if we see those trades we talked about how a black king might want to walk up to E5 and it gives some chances to uh go after some of the white Pawns in the end game and I just want to remind everybody that the players they need to reach move 40 it's only uh the 30th move that was just played once they hit move 40 they gain more time and they gain bonus time with each and every move played so the 30 minutes that they gain will be of huge importance especially if dingly Ren is able to find a way to stabilize and I guess Judith the last few moves haven't changed all that much you have played you know all the best players in the world you've had great positions of course there are going to be some bad positions as well but my question for you is when you have those great positions but you're not like just completely winning yet you're pressing pressing pressing does it get frustrating when you feel like you don't see a breakthrough yet ER yes it's it can be a little bit frustrating but you have to force yourself uh to put yourself uh into the moment and uh try to understand the position what is the best move and what are your goals you cannot think I mean it cannot sneak into the head of gkes that oh my God I'm going to be equalizing the match oh I'm so near to that right no you can't you can't think this way you have to really focus on the game and understand the position and and make the best move so emotional things uh uh it's not the moment when uh when it should be disturbing you uh it's not easy but uh you have to understand that at least you you are in a difficult position from the point of view how you're going to win it but you have to understand that this is a great problem you're having and uh and then put yourself in a perspective that uh it's a great opportunity I shouldn't rush things this is also very important in such a uh time uh situation also of course gkes knows he has a move he wants to do Rook C D1 or whatever but he he wants to control himself and doesn't make very fast moves because he knows that the the winning opportunity is in his hand and he knows that Ding is the person who should be worried much more about time for the moment so it is very important to to control yourself and and be patient in such a positions and we did just see a patient move from GES Rook C to D1 I think something that's quite instructive for the viewers is that kukesh isn't making a quick decision to trade off pieces until he is certain that it's best he can keep the status quo which favors him if what dingly Ren is going to be doing is playing say King E8 King E7 and just back and forth then for GES it might make sense to reach move 40 gain that 30 extra minutes and then be able to use that time to his Advantage because as you said Judith that right now at this stage it might be just up to gash if he continues to play optimally he might already be nearing that one territory so having extra time should favor him but you know there is an interesting moment right now what happens if Black Goes Knight G4 just going after that Bishop on F because after Knight F3 now Rook takes D1 and you don't have uh anything to take back with Okay so let's quickly bring up an analysis board because I think Judah is coming up with an important line that you know dingl Ren is trying to analyze yes the thing is that again you know after every move all the time changes so the king is on E7 it has benefits but it has a diff difficult moment also because now for example after Knight G4 white would be planning to play Knight F3 but we may think that Rook will uh but once we have our board and we can show it it's better it's more fun so if nther three Rook D1 then none of the piece can capture because if King D1 then Knight F2 check if I would take with the Rook then it's Rook G2 but Bishop C5 check the intermediate move I think wins the game because if the king moves away then King D1 and we get with white what we wanted and if Rook D6 goes back that I think it shouldn't work because of taking no don't be so fast on that please wait can I just take that are you saying this isn't well is it enough I don't think so because takes takes and if Rook H1 Bishop E5 ah of course the bishop can just come to Def I thought you know Bishop H3 Rook G2 and Surround that Knight but you're right the bishop comes to E5 so I thought not to take on D6 yet but to take Knight takes H2 Knight takes H2 and uh I thought Bishop H3 and then somehow nothing works for black but I'm not sure I'm right because you can go Bishop E5 just protect everything all at once no but you know what maybe instead of Bishop H3 we could take already on D6 and Rook D1 and then Bishop H3 and Rook D7 nice yeah that's really really important that if the King goes back as you said Bishop H3 and up goes the rook and the Knight is still just off the beaten path it's just stuck over here that looks good enough yeah because after Knight G4 what we have uh at the board right now I think Knight F3 should be the only move isn't it and just great awareness by you Judith that Bishop C5 check I mean you talked about it earlier you knew that this was going to be thematic that once the king stepped forward there might be a useful check on C5 and here it's not just useful it's necessary well there's another option first that's what I I was thinking that after Rook D1 Knight H2 is also possible and maybe that end game would be winning also but without the Rooks I think uh the chances for white to win it's it's uh not that easy maybe especially with opposite color Bishops right Knight F2 we get this type of position and here it's not going to be easy at all not too many pawns remaining yeah Bishop E5 and F4 right get active yeah that looks like a really promising try for black to hold on so and dingly ren okay he's spending a lot of time here Judith I mean look at the clock right now he's about to hit two minutes and he needs to make 10 moves I don't think he's going to get all his moves off in time well let's put it that way I wouldn't like to be in the's place right now oh no Judi remember in the previous world championship match against yand pom he just froze he did just play King to E8 which you see the evaluation part has not changed and also it takes away Bishop C5 check in some of these critical variations so King E8 a perfectly reasonable move but now I'm actually less focused on the ins and outs of the the board I'm just looking at the clock he has 1 minute and 50 seconds to reach move 40 where both players will get an extra 30 minutes on the clock with 30 seconds bonus time with each every move Jud and actually I'm going to ask chat before I even ask you chat do you think dingly Ren is going to reach move 40 in this game Judith do you think he's going to be able to reach move 40 he will reach move 40 but uh not if the position he would like to have oh my goodness can't white just play Bishop G3 right now yes for sure uh I finally to to kick Out The Rook from H2 the unpleasant spot I'm going to go back up to H5 I think and you're probably gonna play Bishop F4 aren't you just to uh keep everything defended yeah after Bishop F4 you might go Rook H4 well now that you mention it Judith that's actually really convenient for dingley Ren because he needs to reach move 40 and those are a series of quick moves that not just quick because it's with the same piece but actually they they follow each other up quite nicely it's a logical sequence from the black side so I guess if you're a gash and you're up this much time you may actually just want to pose practical problems and you don't want to get tricky for the sake of being tricky but you see him looking at the score sheet looking you know at the board probably looking at the clock as well he may instead of just forcing trades which he can't be certain we'll be winning he may want to keep the tension keep more pieces on the board yeah it's it's a question but Bishop G3 somehow looks to me a very sensible continuation and after Rook H5 there is uh probably Bishop takes E5 is not the best right you don't like that to give up the black Square Bishop I am just going to be honest with you I'm usually concerned about the presence of Bishops of opposite color even though white has an extra piece for Just Two pawns so I'm just letting you know I'm nervous about it but it might still just be good so now the big question is whether uh oh no that's no Knight F3 is not possible Knight F3 is not possible now because of Rook D1 no that's an issue because Knight F3 Rook takes D1 Knight takes H2 could be played but then Rook yeah but then Rook D3 yeah and uh my Rook is very passive on on uh G1 one so Bishop G3 is an alternative or there's not so many moves with white you know it's not so funny I mean how is this possible I'm laughing with you because otherwise I'm just going to be banging my head against the table because you know just a couple moves ago we're like okay white just spoiled for Choice plenty of options and then black is doing nothing Rook d8 to D7 King E7 King E8 back and forth and saying prove it gash prove that you can beat me and we haven't found that path forward and certainly gesh hasn't and that's more important than us finding it is can gesh find a road into the black camp and a way to not just have an extra piece for two pawns but actually a winning push yeah it's it's it's the the most annoying to play this with white if you don't have a a clear way right so this is this is a big question because Bishop G3 I would like it pretty much but Rook goes back to H5 and if Bishop F4 you go Rook H4 ah but maybe after Rook H4 to go rook gf1 and just defend the bishop this Knight on D4 is a bit loose but there is no tactical way to exploit that at least not the the moment there no there black can go C5 it's not so easy it's frustrating with white I feel frustrated I'm not even playing the game I'm looking at this position you know we as commentators we don't root for uh the players of course but it's like it should be good for white and that's what every know person watching this is like you know that you have an extra Bishop for Just Two pawns and yet gukesh like he continues to invest time I would say wisely but he doesn't know how to make progress and there's always that question it's not a fortress of course there too many pieces to call it that but where does progress come from Judith I am really struggling to figure that out yes I understand your you're saying of course B4 is something that could be possibility with the later on idea Knight B3 and C5 at the same time of course it's it's it's also a sensitive thing we have Bishop G3 on theard not you could see ding he's like I'm not waiting for you to go right down the move I'm immediately playing Rook to H5 he spent only one second on that move and well he looked up his opponent and Jud I'm going to say that Bishop F4 Rook H4 these moves can happen fast so dingley Ren we've been worried about his time management he now has eight moves to make and he still has a minute 49 so Bishop F4 Rook H4 Rook G1 to F1 C5 is really tempting me but I'm not sure if it's how quality I go Knight C2 yeah so many options there I mean trading Rooks of course with a knight D3 to follow it just feels like black is getting active but maybe it's an optical illusion there it's just all for not yeah Black's position is uh is very compact very tough to crack and white will have to make a decision at one point to exchange what to play Knight F3 and and that way or to go Bishop takes E5 takes Knight F3 Bishop F4 to do it that way so white has to make a choice at some point I believe that Bishop takes E5 it there's uh how do I frame this like there's the consequences are too great so that's why I think gukesh will avoid that because with Bishop takes E5 you allow opposite color Bishops with at the very least in your head you're taught end games Bishops of opposite color drawing Tendencies go up that may not be the case when you're up a minor piece for Just Two pawns but I think that makes it really difficult to commit to that decision because you're not certain about it and you don't want to make such consequential decisions until You' really thought it through and that would be better after move 40 but the more we talk the more time that goes on maybe gas doesn't have all the time in the world to just do whatever he wants because of Moves Like Pawn to C5 at some moment so yeah Judith I I think it's not easy here to be GES well the thing is that white has to make a decision he cannot go back Bishop F2 actually now that I'm saying it m cannot go back he can because Rook G5 is not possible to Bishop H3 vinning material oh that is super nice so I just want to very quickly uh show that just because it's a beautiful tactic Bishop F2 Rook takes G5 oh Knight F3 was played so uh I actually maybe we'll show it a little bit later but you really called a great variation there but okay moves are coming in dingler does not have time the king is up on F3 oh you can't take on G5 in many positions Judah because Bishop H4 and there will be mating Nets against the black king in many positions that's a very nice one this is a very important because now look at that Bishop on G3 Pawn will will be pushed E5 black is cannot take on G5 if he cannot take on G5 I think he has to cannot and if he cannot then The Rook on H5 is completely out of the game so this is uh uh great technique mid Knight F3 B dingly Ren drops the bishop on D4 that's moved 34 everybody 1 minute 7 seconds remaining on his clock he needs to hit move 40 to get that extra time it's much needed for him at this stage and well Judith I mean this position is starting to heat up but it does feel easier for white to play the last couple of Trades I like From gk's perspective yeah it seems like in the last two three moves there was an improvement for white to eliminate the knight from the center one very active piece from black and now the question is can black capture on G5 the pawn is that I'm going stability I'm going to personally trust gash and say the answer is no I think Rook takes G5 me there's like Bishop H3 coming and this Rook on D7 has nowhere good to go exactly which means that probably black will be exchanging on H1 and then uh probably Rook H1 will be the move and gives the opportunity for white very soon to to push E5 Rook H7 put it on the seventh rank the F7 Pawn is uh is so weak that uh probably it will cost the game eventually 20 seconds for dingly r you see he's confused he doesn't know if he can capture that pawn on G5 he is super nervous he has to make a move I mean he just has to and he he picks up his rook and what's he GNA do he he hasn't moved he's freezing oh my goodness back on the clock is dingly run under Bishop H3 and F5 is played here so gesh he knows that he has the upper hand it's now very clear the evaluation bar is Skyhigh and for Dingle Ren he's probably not even going to look at that M five wow what a fine game over gash damaraju equals the match one m one up I think we can hear some Applause in the background in the playing arena in Singapore but Judith wow what a quick finish to that game I'm speechless it's things have speeded up in the last few moves and what a what a game by gash he took the opportunity and equalize the match congratulations to him John you were watching that we see on Dingle Ren's face and that is upset I don't want to call it heartbreak the match is still equal a long way to go but you can see that dingly Ren uh he is very very sad about what just happened uh absolutely Robert that is a crushing result for goash the 18-year-old World Championship Challenger now this of course is by no means a done deal this simply levels the match at one and a half points all but dingly Ren will be lamenting the opportunity to potentially extend a lead here what an incredible final couple of minutes there even though the position was one on the board for white there was so much tension and us watching there was still so much to go through before we could actually work out exactly what was going on and how the game was going to end Judith those emotions in the last couple of minutes even if you know one side is objectively one on the board it doesn't stop the tension it doesn't stop the emotion we're still sitting here on the edge of our seats well the tension is absolutely huge I mean even we commentators I think we feel it how much gesh was close to winning since the move Knight E2 was played it was clear that he has the huge huge Advantage it's clear that it will depend on him if he makes the best moves then he will collect the point and level the match and what a moment especially before the uh the free day I mean and he he played he calculated very well he played very accurately he had the the the patience for it for those moments and it was clear that Ding uh had to play on and he tried his best by stabilizing his position but as I said before his p were very well uh placed but not enough of them and Robert a quick question for you before we go into the game review how important or unimportant is it that this win for gash comes just before arrest day like how significant is that I think that's better news for dingly Ren I mean the win is just necessary and I think Judith said it best when she said he needs to win this game did gash and he did just that but for dingly Ren when you're reing like this to get a day off I think that can be helpful and what else can be helpful is that world championship experience back in the last match against Yan pomi I think there were four decisive games in a row rounds four through seven if I'm not mistaken where they traded blows one side winning then the other returning serve so for dingly Ren I think he will be happy to have the day off tomorrow it may not be a Happy Thanksgiving for dingly Ren not that he celebrates but I think for gesh he enters the reste on a high all right well and an incredible finish to that game and of course hundreds of thousands of people watching the game from all across the globe uh Robert I'm going to pass it back over to you especially for people who maybe were watching the broadcast as tensions reached a boiling point towards the end of that game take us back all the way to the beginning and give us a recap of how today's proceedings have unfolded okay thank you John this is a lot of pressure but it was a very fun game so as we hit the game review we will talk about the ins and outs of what just happened and we will start from the top from the very first moves of the game so here we go we see that the game start off with a different first moov that's the first big detail not E4 no French we got D4 today and I'm going to fast forward through the opening stage because while C takes D5 e takes D5 that early decision that can be discussed in further detail as we fast forward here I think this move H3 that's the first big Wrinkle In the game has been seen before and the point is the gal specialy to push the pawn to G4 and stop the Bishop from safely landing on F5 as the game continued a queen trade was offered and a queen trade was had at this moment Queen takes B3 a takes back and here was a critical moment the bishop it enters enemy territory and it didn't leave the bishop comes to C2 hitting this B3 Pawn but for gesh he had this all worked out Bishop F4 not the first time this has been played the former world champion Vladimir cronick he essayed just this against arjan gayi in the 2023 World rapid championship ship if I'm remembering the tournament but Bishop F4 comes out Bishop takes B3 just quickly to show not really available the bishop it's getting hounded and trapped if it goes back to C4 this is a critical detail it is going to be a pawn back for white because after B5 Knight takes thank you very much I will grably grably gladly grab material excuse me I'm mixing my words together maybe that's a new one add to the dictionary but you will not be surviving this with the Rook on A8 lost so as the game continued here we saw H5 good decision Rook G1 we saw a capture Knight bd7 exclam I would say from dingly Ren a necessary move because after the Knight drop back to D2 Rook G8 trying to play G5 and open up a path back for this bishop to survive on the light squares and here's where guesh went wrong he had to make the move Rook to C1 allowing G5 the bishop slides back the bishop survives for black it's a complicated battle chances for both sides white slightly theci side for choice but in the game instead G5 was gha's Choice the Knight hops to H5 with Tempo the bishop back Rook h8 another move that deserves an exclamation point going after this loose Bishop on H2 stopping Bishop H3 as well because of too much pressure down the open H file so as we continue F3 trying to play E4 and for dingly Ren Knight G7 a step back but a step in the right direction that Knight regroups reroutes Knight E6 go after the G5 and D4 pawns are loose pawns across the board but here I would say the critical moment of the game Rook H5 it deserves a question mark maybe even two we don't mean to be harsh but the bishop on C2 is trapped it is in enemy territory and if they go back a step here instead of this move Rook H5 both Bishop to E7 going after the pawn on G5 with the bishop to try to get this Knight on D2 out of the way as well or Bishop F5 just saving the piece that did in fact get trapped that was the way to go you see the evaluation slightly better for black in the game though neither of those choices made H5 question mark E4 play deserves that exclamation point and as the dust settled in the middle of the board black wasn't even able to get a third Pawn for the Lost piece Bishop F2 only move here Bishop G7 and this fine you see the blue arrow it's not for me it's saying this is the only move that gives white the advantage every single other move say Bishop D4 just to show you what this looks like after Rook G2 things like this bishop takes B3 Knight takes back and Bishop to E3 we see that there will be that third third Pawn an essential third Pawn for the Lost minor piece instead Knight E2 Knight takes B3 and only two pawns pardon that siren but the ambulance it was needed in this one because you're not getting that minor piece back black has Five Pawns white has three two pawns not enough and as the game continued it did look challenging King E2 the right Square Jude and I were struggling to figure out exactly where to go and as this one went forward from here black is going back and forth doing the right thing but but then right here and right now King E8 took way too much time from dingly Ren you see 6 minutes and 32 seconds remain at this moment after the move 1 minute 50 seconds it was the right move but unfortunately took him too much time which makes it the wrong decision Rook back to H5 and Knight F3 a good decision and here dingly Ren had to play Rook takes D1 and after The Rook takes back on D1 maybe keep more pieces on the board with Knight to D7 just keep some options alive it's not that easy to break through but Dingle Ren did not have time he spent way too much of it early he spent way too much on the previous decision King d8 and after Knight takes F3 King takes F3 another proper recapture Bishop D4 was played it's kind of last ditch effort territory because the pawn on G5 was not available to capture showing that real quick Rook takes G5 allowed Rook takes D7 King takes D7 and The Rook slides to D1 with check if the King goes back to E8 Bishop H4 and if the King goes forward Bishop H3 check f and these positions it's not going to work out for black the open board is an issue we get a position like this and white has many choices rookie1 but the last Pawn does remain and the black king is in trouble King safety is Paramount and it can still be attacked the Bishops work together very nicely in this position and so that would have been a winning Advantage for gash in this the game it ended quite quickly Rook H1 Rook takes G5 Bishop H3 and we actually saw at the game end at this moment after Rook H5 there were no more moves played but Bishop takes F5 the blue arrow but it's a dagger to the heart of Black's position Bishop takes F5 if you take with the pawn you lose your Rook on H5 that Defender is removed and Rook takes H1 no you're not taking back you throw in the intermo bishop takes D7 with check and once the king takes Back The Rook on H1 is gone so Bishop takes F5 that sealed the deal it didn't even get to that point because dingl Ren had no time he had no hope and now he has no lead in the match it is officially 1 and a half 1 and half and that is your game review of the third game of this fed world championship match thank you so much Robert a lot to unpack there and I thought you got pretty much all of the points there absolutely spot on what a classy finish as well from gesh obviously ding under time pressure there uh unfortunately capitulating but this match just got very interesting uh Judith let's zoom out from today's game and talk about the match overall 1 and A2 one and a half now uh ding has won with the black pieces ding has lost with the black pieces what do you think him and his team are thinking going into the rester well they are not happy this I can tell you this is this not go this game was not a a loss which you you just lost the game it was a very painful loss I believe for Ding and this is not exactly he was counting with because uh in the opening he was kind of thinking how to react and what to do and then after G5 he just relieved I think completely and said okay I have great position and things are going on very fine but then very quickly he made a mistake which was uh which was something will hunt him I think uh tonight maybe or for sometime so probably he will need this free day for sure but I also think that for gash it's great to have a free day after winning to calm himself self down that now he leveled the mat all right folks uh we'll come back to what team team gesh rather might be thinking in a little bit because I believe the press conference with both players is likely to start in the next couple of minutes so we're going to go to a brief break where we will still get to see the cameras so that we can pop back immediately if necessary and we'll be back in just a moment with the press conference and we'll have some closing thoughts after that see you guys in a sec [Music] [Music] hello everyone and welcome to the postgame press conference I'm marce Ashley and I will be asking a couple of questions of the players those of you who have questions from the Press uh there's a microphone to our left that you can go to you can line up at any point and please res restrict your questions to one at a time but if you need to go back then we'll allow you to do so first question is for the Challenger first of all GES congratulations on the victory today I guess the simplest Wesson to ask is how does it feel to actually win a game in your first world championship yeah uh it feels great um I'm uh I'm quite happy with uh I mean also the last two days I was happy with my play today was was even better um I I feel good at the board and uh yeah today I just managed to out play my opponent which is always very nice I'm curious how the opening went for you he's he spent a lot of time in the opening at one point uh just several minutes for sure did you feel like you had exactly the position you wanted to play uh yeah um I was prepared until uh until the 11th no sorry 13th more uh I I guess he was trying to remember something but maybe he mixed up something I I I thought how we reacted was not the most precise way and then uh and then I think I just got a very nice position after after G5 and I mean all this F3 E4 it looks really shaky for a question uh for you alician you you spent a lot of time in the opening what what was the reason for that oh because I thought my position not so comfortable and my C2 Bishop is a weakness and he's going to attack it with Knight D2 so I try to come up with some idea to save it first I saw Knight E4 here maybe the other move to play Knight E4 and if we take I take with bishop and Knight D2 196 the other I'm not sure evolution bit and I should and choose between these two two lines uh we were everyone was analyzing of course with the aid of engines and I felt that your response was probably the best under the circumstances uh and here after G5 Knight back first excuse me right 92 first and G5 and and here you seem to have a good position after this if the way you played uh but that Rook H5 was a significant error did you understand this at the moment or or did it take you some time to realize that your Bishop was in trouble I think my position already in trouble because no more 96 doesn't work due to Rook C1 and I saw Bishop E7 but I refus it due to Rook C1 Bishop F5 E4 take um Bishop E2 B E4 Bishop B6 take and Bishop takes Knight takes P takes and Rook C7 but uh after 96 when I saw a computer after the game Knight E6 Rook B7 and a66 E6 and here or maybe Knight D2 Knight D4 also but stronger A6 it looks like you're okay yes yeah did you see any of these lines by the way CU it seemed as though Bishop E7 was problematic for for white actually in uh yeah I think I just underestimated this bishop A7 because I thought if I'm getting like Rook 7 E4 I should be good but now that I see it yeah it's quite shaky uh but uh yeah I guess during the game we both thought that white is doing well which which is what matters I guess that doesn't change things competitively both of you have to play without the use of engines while you're playing so for you it's just a fight right whoever plays better in the fight yeah um I mean it's uh it's obviously not pleasant to uh misjudge a position so uh so badly but but okay uh as long as I played better than my open I think it's good all right I'll open up the floor for questions from the Press um a great performance gesh just to know if you were aware that you were following a game of the 2023 dor F World teams between KCK Ed was that part of your preparation and what do you think of that of that game and how you could improve on that game yeah I mean I I recall that this game very briefly I I think till hg4 we had the same position till the 13th move we had the same position after that I think Arjun made some some mistake and karnik had a huge Advantage but it ended in a draw I remember this detail but uh but I didn't I I don't remember exactly how the game went um yeah yeah I was aware of it next question hi Gish uh can you just you know uh talk the entire uh thought process of all the moves that you had made after Rook H 5 it at least on the board it it seemed like you knew that you know you now had an advantage you just talk through the entire process of how you converted that the calculations that you were doing in your mind yeah uh after Rook H5 I thought uh uh thought with E4 I'm uh okay I'm winning a piece but he gets a couple of Pawns and I mean the dark squares are a bit uh bit uh soft so I didn't think I was completely completely winning I knew that I should be uh better or close to winning and then I think I played quite precisely because I was also considering Knight E2 instead of Bishop F2 but then but then he can go Knight B3 I mean the same uh similar to what happened in the game like Rook C2 Knight D2 Rook D2 Bishop B4 now the difference is G5 hands uh yeah Bishop B4 or direct G5 um yeah something like this so I thought Bishop F2 uh to start with then Knight E2 uh yeah I mean I just thought I had to be like super precise not to give him any uh any drawing chances and uh and I did not really see where he could really improve actually maybe maybe King E7 was the final mistake but already I thought I was doing pretty well uh yeah and also in the end this tactic was really nice that I had calculator uh in the very end yeah Bishop H3 F5 Bishop F1 Bishop F5 was going to play you were going to play yeah mhm so yeah next question uh hi there Theo from lee.org um I'm asking a question on behalf of one of our live stream commentators Grandmaster Felix blow Berger uh he wanted to ask ding Lan if he could share his thinking behind Rook H5 and if he considered or evaluated the threat of Knight E2 well um before F3 I thought my postion was okay or even better but after F3 I realized maybe it's not so easy to play and the most over was move 9 for knight6 doesn't work so I have to come up with the other ideas and I Al I also saw Bishop B7 but I refuse it because the line I show show before that's why I come up with Rook F5 with idea Rook C1 Bishop F5 E4 maybe take Tak and Bishop H7 Bishop H3 The Rook is predicted on H5 but I under estimated E4 and in this line I I miss the Knight E2 actually I thought he will he had to move the Rook on Rook then take on D4 with the bishop then I have good compensations you're saying in this position here yes yes you missed 92 yes and you said you thought what did he have to play Rook move to somewhere G2 or somewhere like this m so so for you this was the decisive yeah mistake next question this is Mike CL with chess.com my question is for Grandmaster gash this appears to be the first time since game one of 93 Kasparov short where someone lost on time and I'm curious even though your position was objectively always winning uh were you having can you describe your emotions as your opponent was ticking down on time we could see it on his face but was what was going through your mind is he had you know one minute left to make six moves um I I'm sorry uh maybe the previous match like didn't he lose on time against nepo uh it's my it's my uh research team's uh research so even if that is incorrect could you tell us about uh could you tell us about your uh your motions uh when he had so little time to make so many moves yeah um yeah I was pretty confident at that point uh I mean I was just thinking about the position at that time because I knew that I should should be winning especially after like after I got Rook D1 I mean Rook C1 Rook D1 I I I thought I should just be winning so yeah I wasn't really playing for time I just wanted to uh like uh I mean finish it off cleanly I know you weren't playing for time but was there an increased heart rate or anything going on inside you as your opponent got so low yeah uh sure I I mean it's always like a bit exciting when when you're hoping is solo on time and also uh I mean when you when you get a winning position you generally get get a bit excited so it was there but I think I had my emotions under control thanks sh uh asking on behalf of Fay social media from my followers this time from Bangalore chess club did having a rest day tomorrow have any effect on today's game approach is that for both both players um go ahead uh not really uh I I mean I I thought since tomorrow is a rest day I'll just uh put all my energy into this game and then then I have uh and then I can rest so uh did it did not make much of a difference but it was nice that nice to know that uh like after today's game I can just go and rest not really but the results of the game will maybe influence my emotion during the rest day hi U Maria milanova on behalf of my viewers I guess on my channel a bit of a harsh question to GES but I thought it's the best day to ask it do you agree with what Magnus said after game one that it's hard to understate how bad this was from GES uh not a single good decision everything was wrong do you agree with this his statement and do you think you change if yes then do you think something changed after game one uh in game one you mean um yeah I mean after from some point I think starting from I don't know maybe before or que need to like uh especially this Knight D4 move all these moves were pretty bad but uh but I think it's also understandable since it was my first game in the bu Championship I was I was a bit nervous it's a new setting for me and uh yeah I mean like even even for example Magnus in his first world championship he uh he was not at his best in at the start so I think it's a very normal reaction uh and I and I was okay with that I was a bad game but I was generally feeling good uh I thought uh even though I was nervous I was able to like not uh like uh what to say I it was not too much to handle so I felt good it was a bad game but uh but yeah I I always knew that once I settle and I will I will get back my rhythm thank you and congratulations on striking back talk fromi Germany a question for ding um what was the point in the opening when you were caught by surprise was it move H3 already or could you say something about that yes very early actually uh this line came as a surprise totally yes um it maybe after3 I have no knowledge to for this one uh another question for gash uh by the way it looks like last year ding may have resigned with 3 seconds remaining so uh I'm not sure we'll we'll check on that but uh my question is this is your first classical win over ding I know the sample size is incredibly small does that mean anything extra to you that you've broken through against him um yeah it's uh it's always nice to um nice to win a game also for the first time against against such a strong opener it's it's always nice I think it means more that uh I got a win in the world championship and and very important win so yeah I'm happy with many things about this uh hi gkes adya from chess base India uh congratulations on your first World Championship win but we see you here today exactly as after game one you are in the same mood your nerves show the same level uh I don't know how you do it but congratulations um could you please tell us that uh when we saw you in game one you were a lot moving around the chair you were not sitting that much but today we saw you on the chair more focused more concentrated eyes closed what changed uh is it something that your coaches or your seconds have given some advice to you or is this something you are taking forward in the match I think it also depends on uh it mostly I think just depends on the kind of position because uh the first game I thought I would prepared him and uh I I mean like uh all this G4 it was it was all my prep and I I was feeling more in control so and uh yesterday I mean he surprised me in the opening had to figure things out and also today once he got like uh uh Queen B3 Bishop to I mean there there were lot of lines to calculate even though it was my prep I I couldn't recall many many things so um yeah I just uh had many things to figure out on the boat so just sitting great congrats once again thank you before the next question if I may ask uh does the thought ever bubble in your mind of that you have fans big fans watching from all around the world particularly in your home country does that ever affect you when you're actually sitting there playing is that or you're not distracted by these thoughts um usually when I'm playing it's like not really but uh like in a span of like four 5 hours you get one or two distracting thoughts from time to time and I think it's it's fine but uh but yeah in general it's nice that uh like uh know fans all over the world and especially in my home country are uh um uh are cheering for me in this match and and that is kind of a motivating factor for me uh I have a question for [Music] another question from Fay social media this time from Sky 3510 for both of you what are you planning to do for the rest day um no plans as of yet but uh um but okay maybe I don't know I'll think of something and but okay the main things will be obviously some rest preparation and and some relaxation well I I don't have plan for tomorrow yeah we'll see after getting up I do have one final final question um you have lost before in a world championship match many people counted you out when you lost before and you bounced back time and time and time again what gives you the strength to bounce back or gave you the strength and do you feel I mean and what's going to give you the strength now well uh just the position itself I think if I have a chance in the game I need to press for the win okay that concludes the press conference tomorrow is a day off so rest day for the players rest day for everyone else we'll be back in two days here at 5:00 P p.m local time good night everyone thank you very much uh Maurice and the players for giving us quite a lot to talk about from that press conference actually um Judit I want to start with a very interesting observation that I think a lot of people uh watching will have noticed as well gukesh could be talking about his win today gesh could be talking about his loss and he could even be responding to that shots fired possibly illegal in Singapore kind of question that we saw face completely the same throughout he was so mature he was so measured and he gave such a brilliant answer he's unflappable yes this is seeable for for whatever interview he gave not only now but in previous occasions as well that he's so stable mentally that uh I'm pretty sure that sometimes he's not that stable but he he can give great answers and and show that he's not going to be unbalanced by all these questions because he's so focused he's so determined that he knows exactly why he came to Singapore and if you are uh if you're in the opposing Camp right now Robert we did get a bit more emotion from ding he settled down by the time the press conference was had we're not even sure 100% what he's thinking about right now there are no plans for the rest day we'll play it by ear let's just get back to the hotel and reset talk to us about his mental state and how he can best use the rest day to um put himself in a good position because he's done it before he certainly has and he can do it again and I think the issue is that there are emotions he just lost a game three he had a lead in the match but if we could try to be objective here he has played two games with the black pieces only one game with white before the match began if you said ding heading into the first rest day you'll have one and a half out of three uh you maybe you drew your first three games he would say I'll take that because I have more whites pieces in the remaining games the problem is he just l lost and we just saw him there uh on the stage being quite disheartened he seemed quite sad for him and his team they would hope to use the rest a to recover but objectively speaking one and a half points out of three when you play two black games and only one white that is a good result for dingly Ren so I just want to state that clearly I of course note that emotions do play a role we'll see how this loss impacts him but on paper at the very least ding Ren is doing quite well that's a fantastic Point Robert I mean at the end of the day like you say one and a half out of three where you've had two blacks is still fine we just maybe wait most recent results more heavily in our mind a little bit of a psychological imbalance there but strictly speaking it is very much all to play for objectively let's take a look now at what the schedule's going to be for the next games because it's important to remember that tomorrow is a rest day so we are going to be coming back not tomorrow but on Friday ladies and gentlemen uh we will have a little bit of a one-day break the players themselves will have a hard-earned break as well and on Friday we start at 5:00 in the afternoon Singapore local time and you can see what the equivalent will be where you are in the world on this lovely map here ranging from 1:00 in the morning on the west coast all the way to 8:00 in the evening if you are joining us from Sydney right well that leaves things very nicely poised indeed uh Judit we've had fantastic emotions this isn't the same even though it's 1 and a half 1 and a half it's not the same as three quick draws it's not the same as three boring games we've had a very wide range of play in this world championship match so far and it's all square going into the first rest day what do you think well it's uh you know we are in the roller coaster it goes up and down it was incredible day one and even yesterday with the draw it was not long but it was very interesting and today it was very clear that gash will come back to try to equalize and level the match and he made a surprise in the opening which I think is a very important psychological win for gash because to surprise your opponent it's always very special but to do that in a world championship match again and again it has gives extra points for your self-confidence so he made one uh suspicious move G5 but after that and before that he played incredibly well and in critical moments he was able to make the right decision and then convert completely in securing his victory there so it was an amazing day and I want to close it with that you remember that when after his loss what he said it was it only makes only more exciting now so now again we can say that it's one and a half one and a half and uh we are moving into the full excitement into the almost middle of the match by now H that's very well put and exactly right GES did say that after the first loss oh I guess this makes things more interesting then and he has certainly notched up the level one more today uh Robert piggybacking off of Judith's comment about surprising your opponent out of the opening I feel like people in general and maybe rightly so uh spoke a lot about ding working with Richard report so uh perhaps to us maybe where we've been blindsided from reading so much into other stuff guess what things can come the other way as well they certainly can because when the cooks are in the kitchen they might prep a great meal and for the many Americans watching I think tomorrow is a day full of cooking and preparation for Thanksgiving but for team ding you know that Richard report and the rest of uh the players who are working with ding they're going to be hard at work they are not taking a day off they're going to try to find a surprise here or there just like ding did in the first game on his first move E6 a French defense that was not expected so what we can expect is more fighting more uh just difficult chess decisions to be made but I think for GES he has settled in once that first game the the nerves they're out the window as Judith said even though we're only three games in we're in the middle of the match at least from the uh perspective of the players they are right in the thick of things and we have so much fun ahead so three games down in the 2024 feed world championship and the scores are Level 1 and a half one and a half but by possibly the most exciting route possible dingly Ren the defending Champion Wins Game number one extremely tense draw in game number two followed by the Challenger gesh striking back in game number three to make things all square going into the rest day we will be back here on stream on Friday same time same place for round number four of the FED World Championship stay safe wherever you are in the world and we'll see you then good night game number three of the Fay World Championship is officially a go GES has made the first move one D4 from GES a pause from dingly Ren as he thinks what does gash want from me H3 this Choice 7 H3 from gash it's taking this game into unfamiliar territory we might see a chaotic game I am nervous for him he is down serious time right now and it's not just the clock I think in fact it's the board that poses even more problems because he is not familiar and his opponent is he has played the best move Knight B to D7 that was time very well spent by dingly re suddenly I don't feel that there are such a huge dangers for thing anymore the last move played here Judith was a mistake from dingly Ren we see the question mark and the only proper reply that gives white the upper hand is this move E4 E4 has been played it's dingly Ren on the back foot and look at that Knight E6 the only move for black and he makes a mistake here he took on e4 first I believe there can be equalizing the match before the free day and KN E2 is on the board huge fine from gash he's feeling good about his position he has 1 minute and 50 seconds to reach move 40 he has to make a move I mean he just has to and he he picks up his rook and what's he going to do he he hasn't moved he's [Music] freezing oh my goodness back on the clock is dingly running Bishop H3 and F5 is played here so gesh he knows that he has the upper hand it's now very clear the evaluation bar is Skyhigh and for dingly Ren he's probably not even going to Bishop look that five wow what a fine game over gues damaraju equals the match one m one I think we can hear some Applause in the background in the playing arena in Singapore but Judith wow what a quick finish to that [Music] game Gemini can you help me plan my 3-day vacation generate a photo of a muscly copy [Music] bar explain the concept of supply and demand

        "transcript": "no Queen too early the queen is so powerful that if you move her out early she'll be threatened to get smashed and you'll need to move her again for example in this position the queen gets hit by the Knight and then it gets hit again by another Knight you move the queen multiple times and let your opponent develop their pieces this is dumb don't do that don't move the same piece twice in the opening if you move the same piece twice what the hell cheu doing with your life develop quick control the scene don't waste your turns be bold and mean anyways if you move a piece twice you're not developing quickly enough unless you're hiura nakamuro stick to this principle develop quickly develop or die said some Grandmaster probably this principle means you should get your Bishops Knights and Queen off the back rank as well as Castle to connect your Rooks as soon as possible when you do your king is super safe and your pieces are ready to smash the opponent's king avoid double pawns double pawns happen when two Pawns of the same color are on the same file when this occurs the pawns can't defend each other and are very prone to attack it's generally a good idea to avoid double pawns and even though people have attempted to make the legendary tripled pawns things usually don't end well for [Applause] them avoid isolated pawns isolated pawns are pawns that have no pawns nearby to protect it these kinds of pawns are very easy to kill and usually big targets for your opponent a strategy to get rid of isolated pawns is to sacrifice it to ruin your opponent's Pawn structure and then capture them back later endgame King is valuable the king is pretty much a loser in the opening however in the end game it becomes a God and you should bring it out as soon as possible in this position white is completely winning because White's King is much more active and will very soon capture these three black pawns Castle before move 10 while you can technically wait till move 69 to Castle and deliver a castle checkmate back here in castles wait I've never even seen this game what don't try that at home you'll most likely get and be delivered home in an ambulance just Castle early and get checkmated like Magnus no Rooks go behind passed pawns if you have a pass pawn put a rook behind it this makes sure that the pawn is protected while The Rook remains active and can do other things I'm not sure I can take them all don't worry bro I got your back Bishops open Knights closed Bishops are better in open positions because they can control squares and attack from afar when they're in closed positions however they become pretty useless because they're blocked by their own pawns Knights are the opposite they move slowly like snails in open positions however in closed positions they can hop around and go to places no other pieces can backward pawns backward pawns are pawns that are left undefended because its Brothers have been pushed forward or captured similar to isolated Pawns this kind of Pawn usually becomes a target for your opponent avoid moving Pawns in front of castled King pawns are there to protect your king if you push Pawns in front of your king at the wrong time your king will get smashed by your opponent's pieces always play and passant when given the chance and passant is not just a chess move it's a way of life in this chess match Bobby was faced with an important decision should he Checkmate his opponent or play and passant being an absolute King Bobby chose and passant and with that he saf rice the game don't trade Bishops for Knights as a rule of thumb Bishops are usually better than Knights because they are longrange pieces and can sometimes unexpectedly your opponent from afar in this position even though you can trade your Bishop for the Knight creating double pawns for your opponent you probably shouldn't Knights before Bishops it is generally better to move Knights first because you can pretty much bet money that the knights will go here or here Bishops however have a lot more options so you should wait and decide later Knights are the best blockaders of Pawns Knights are really good with blocking pawns this is because the Knight naturally controls the defending squares of that pawn so it's harder for other pawns to support it in this situation for example black can't push B5 because it'll get captured don't play hope chess hope chess is when you play chess and you hope your opponent will make the move you want or somehow screw up don't do that instead instead you should always imagine that your opponent will always play the best move and plan accordingly I hope he doesn't see [Applause] me connect Rooks Rooks are stronger as a pair connecting Rooks means removing any pieces that stand between them so that they see each other for example in this position the queen can move out of the way so the Rooks protect each other two minor pieces are better than a rook and pawn if we count the material both a rook and Pawn and two minor pieces are six points of material however trading two minor pieces for a rook and pawn usually is a bad idea because two minor pieces can control more squares and coordinate to deliver stronger attacks in this position for example trading causes white to lose one point of Advantage three minor pieces are better than a queen in the same way three minor pieces can usually be more useful than a single queen even though they are equally worth nine points capture toward the center with pawns when given the opportunity to take a piece or a PA PA with your own Pawn you should always look to take towards the center if possible for example in this position white has the option to take Black's Bishop with either pawn and the better option is to take it with the a pawn because that move builds stronger attacks towards the center and it also opens the file for The Rook control the center the center is the most OP area of a chess game if you control the center it'll be very hard for your opponent to do sh so use your Knights Bishops and pawns to control your Center when you can and thank me later don't open the center if you're King is still there if your king is still in the center it is not a good idea to trade or play moves that would allow your opponent to open the center and attack your king in this position black hasn't castled yet and a move like D5 wouldn't be good because after a trade white gains a half-opened file that can be a potential danger to the King two connected pawns on Sixth rank beat Rook if you have two connected pawns on the sixth rank there's not much that a rook can do to save the game a common strategy is to sacrifice one Pawn to let the other Pawn promote opposite colored Bishop pieces are dangerous in the middle game in this position black is up a knight however because the two Bishops are of opposite colors this bishop is attacking squares that the other Bishop can never defend and Checkmate is Unstoppable if black has a dark Square Bishop it would have been a totally different story opposite colored Bishops drawsh in the end game in the end game opposite colored Bishops are very drawish Believe It or Not these two positions are both theoretically draws Rooks on open files there are three types of files closed semi-opened and opened Rooks are pretty miserable when they're on closed files in this position all the files are closed so white can make no progress and it is a dead draw but if white has one less Pawn this file becomes semi-opened and black is Attack Base of Pawn chain a pawn chain is a few connected pawns which control a lot of space together in this position all of these pawns are protected except for the one at the base once that pawn is gone the other Pawns can be captured one by one when a head trade pieces but not Pawns in this example you're up a rook for a knight this is a pretty big deal you can simply use your Rook to scoop up all black pawns and winning is inevitable if you trade all pawns though even Magnus Carlson can't win this position because it is a freaking theoretical draw unless the opponent has a seizure when down trade pawns but not pieces similarly to the last principle if you are black trading all of your pawns is what you want to do because that is how you will increase your chance to get a draw from a lost position Knights on the rim are Grim when a knight is on the rim it can only see two squares however when it's in the middle it controls eight squares in total so to keep your Knights happy and productive don't put it on the rim if the position is cramped trade pieces in a cramped position such as this one your pieces don't have any space to do sh so the best thing you can do is simplify the position by trading pieces when you see a good move look for a better move when you find a good move and think you are Hikaru always stop for a second and look for a better move that will make you look like Magnus Carlson in this position a rookie would take the rook and feel pretty good about himself hearu would immediately realize that Knight to E6 is an immediate KO however only Magnus Carlson would know that an imp passant move is available and take advantage doubled Rooks on open files are powerful if you line up two Rooks one behind the other on an open file that file can become a big problem for the opponent as they can't easily get it back Rooks are strong on Seventh or second rank if you can get your Rooks to the seventh rank for White and the second rank for black your opponent will be in deep this is where most of the pawns are so you can just take them one by one there is also a lot of nasty Checkmate potential when your Rooks are lining up like this deal with an attack on the flank with an attack on the center in this position black is attempting to launch an attack on the right flank because the white king is castled what white can do is to strike back in the center because the black king is not yet castled and things will look really bad for black really fast know the right time to ignore principles and of course if you want to be a good chess player there will be times when these principles will have to be ignored in order to make the best move in the situation have fun and bad luck",

        "transcript": "I dropped out of college, was\nin debt, working 60 hours a week, hated my job,\nand most importantly, I felt stuck. This is the\nstory of how I learned how to code\nwithin four months, and I got a job. I did it with no computer science\ndegree or a coding BootCamp I am going to explain\nexactly what I learned, how I got\na job, and how much that job paid. Let's go. Before\nI got into tech, I was working\na lot of dead end sales jobs, because I dropped\nout of community college and\nI didn't really have any other skills. I didn't like the\nidea of always having to hop from\njob to job If I didn't like something. I wanted something with a little\nbit more career mobility long term. I didn't\neven really know what coding was. I just\nknew that the tech industry was,\nlet's say, a great environment for $180 grand now $200 ish $250,000 $400,000 annually growth... Yeah. By the way, I'm not knocking sales. I think sales\nis a really important skill to learn. I just needed a change, and it\nreally just wasn't for me long term. And I wanted to gain the ability\nto build something of my own. The idea of building\nsomething from zero to one\nseemed like a superpower to me. Day one, I just went on\nGoogle and I typed in how to code. That's when I found a site called\nFreeCodeCamp, and I started\nto learn about web development. I quickly learned about HTML, CSS, and I learned\nabout my first real programming\nlanguage called JavaScript. There's\na bunch of different programming\nlanguages that you could learn, but I personally\nchose JavaScript because\nI wanted to build web apps. Even\nmajor companies like Uber and\nAirbnb use it, and there's a massive\ndemand for it in the job market. By using FreeCodeCamp, I started\nto learn the basics of coding. I learned things like variables,\nloops, objects, and functions. But even after\ndoing the tutorials, I didn't really\nfeel like I could apply to anything. And I still didn't\neven know how to do something\nas basic as building a website. And I realized that I learned how to\ncode, not exactly how to program. I was writing\ncode to solve logic problems,\nbut I didn't know how to program, which is using\nthe code to build something useful. At this point, though, already\nI was starting to love the journey. I really liked problem solving,\nand I could see myself doing\nsomething like this long term. So\nI did what any sane person would\ndo and I quit my job and I moved\nto Korea to minimize my expenses. And I decided to learn full time. Learning full time\nwas a lot harder than I thought. I've\nactually never studied anything\nthis complicated or tough before, and I was quickly starting\nto realize that I didn't really\nknow how to study at this pace. I would sit in front of my computer\nand hours and hours would go by. That was when I went\nonline, I typed in how to learn. And\nI found a course called \"Learning\nhow to Learn\" by Barbara Oakley. This course was life changing. My two main\ntakeaways were one, it taught me\nhow to learn in space segments,\nA technique called Pomodoros. And the course\ntaught me that I needed to create\na dedicated space for learning. So I joined a Coworking\nspace, so I could focus better. Now,\narmed with new knowledge, I got\nback to studying. And it worked. Here's\nwhat a normal day looked like. 08:00 a.m wake up. 8:30, Head to the train station. 09:00\na.m. Arrive at the coworking space. 9:15, Coffee Journaling\nreviewing the curriculum. 9:30 to 12:30,\nI would have my first study session, where I did 30\nminutes increments of Pomodoros. From 12:30\nto 1:30, I would eat lunch and take a\nsmall break, then back to studying. From\n02:00 p.m to 6:30, it was more 30\nminutes increments of Pomodoros\nuntil I was ready to head out. From 6:30 to 7:30,\nI would gym three times a week, And then 8:30\nto 9:00, I would eat dinner with\nmy grandma, then help her clean. This was my schedule\nfor six days a week, no exceptions. The next part of FreeCodeCamp\nwas a lot more challenging. Front end projects. They essentially give you a list\nof projects that you have to build\nusing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To me, this felt like\na massive jump because I never\nactually built anything before. I felt stuck at this stage\nuntil I found a YouTube channel\nof this guy named Stephen who would stream himself\nbuilding these projects line by line. By copying him\nand recreating what he was doing, I was able to\nuse that experience and build the\nnext couple of projects on my own. I also found a great resource\ncalled watchandcode.com,\nwhere you watch and code. By following along once again\nand modeling others, the concepts\nreally started to take hold, and I was really starting\nto understand what I was doing,\nnot just solving a math problem. In exactly one month, I ended\nup earning my FreeCodeCamp\nFront End Developer certificate. I was\nlearning a lot, but I never actually\nbuilt anything full stack before. Something with a\nfront end or an interface, the thing\nthat you see within the browser. A database where all\nthe information lives, essentially, and a server\nwhich handles and manipulates\nall the data in the back end by taking\nin requests from the front end. So I still felt like an\nimposter and not a real developer. You're not an intellectual.\nYou're a fake and a fraud. So to\nbecome a programmer, I decided\nto build my first full stack project. Remember\nStephen with a YouTube channel? I reached out to him\nto get his assistance to help me\nbuild my first full stack web app, we decided\nto meet three times a week. Here's what we did. We picked one\nmajor overarching project which\nwill teach me the basics of CRUD, which\nis Create, read, update and delete. These are the foundations\nfor any web application. I decided to clone Pinterest. I honestly don't think\nI would have gotten a job without\nthis next part, so pay attention. I asked Stephen\nto treat me like a real junior\ndeveloper working at a company. We implemented a project\nmanagement tool called Jira. We used\nJira to compartmentalize the entire\nproject and write the requirements\nof exactly what I'd be building. This taught\nme how to estimate my work\nand plan how to build an entire\nweb app from zero to launch. We also set\nthe project up on GitHub, which\nis a version control application. This taught me how to develop\ndifferent branches for when\nI was working on certain features, and I could learn how to control\ndifferent versions of the code. Most tech companies use some\nversion of the two applications because being a developer isn't\njust about knowing how to code. It's about knowing\nhow to work collaboratively\nwith other people as well. Stephen grilled me on\nour pair of programming sessions. He was\nvery strict about me keeping the\ndeadlines and the estimates that\nI originally wrote out for myself. He would constantly question\nwhy I was doing what I was doing. And\nhe even taught me the concept\nof DRY, just Don't Repeat Yourself, or essentially\njust making reusable code. I had to learn how\nto build by Googling for answers\nand using sites like Stack Overflow. And he\nwould leave me a lot of comments\non things that I needed to change. So I learned\nhow to debug my code on my own. This made\nme feel like I was a real developer. at this time, I supplemented\nmy learning journey with\nUdemy courses on React and Node because these\nwere the two frameworks that\nI chose to build my Pinterest clone. As a result of building\nmy first full stack project, I ended\nup learning how to do things like how to design a database, build\nAPIs, set up Auth, and eventually\npush the app to a cloud server. These\nare all things I would have never\nlearned by just doing tutorials. And\nin around two months, I finished\nmy first full-stack web app. I remember when I finished the\napp, I felt like a real programmer. That's when reality\nset in and I realized I'm still broke. I haven't made a single\npenny in over a couple of months,\nand I still needed to find a job. It was time\nto see if everything that I learned\nwas actually worth anything. First,\nI defined the job that I wanted. I wanted to be remote. And most\nimportantly, I wanted to work for\na small to medium sized company, because I hate working\nin a corporate environment. I found\nall the jobs that fit my parameters\non sites like weworkremotly.com\nand remoteok.io And instead\nof just applying to these jobs, I found\nthe contact information of the\nhiring managers and developers\nwho worked at the company, and I messaged\nthem to introduce myself. I explained\nexactly what I had learned up until\nthis point,what I was looking for. I even included\nthe link to my GitHub so they could\nsee the projects that I had built. Most importantly,\nI included an offer that\nI know that they couldn't refuse. I offered to work for free. And I understand\nguys, not everyone can afford to do\nthis, but I had originally estimated that this was going to take\nme around four months anyways. And I had\nanother month of time that I could\nessentially dedicate to learning. I knew all I had to do\nwas get my foot into a company,I\ncould essentially learn there and then prove\nmy worth over time to leverage\nthat into a real job long term. Overall, I found around\n22 jobs I thought fit the parameters\nof what I was looking for. I got\naround six responses. From those\nresponses, I got four interviews. And out\nof the four interviews, I ended up\ngetting three legitimate job offers. Even\nthough I had offered to work for\nfree, after the technical interviews, the employers thought that I had\nenough skills at that point where I\nwas worth hiring for a full time job. I ended up choosing the company\nwith the best opportunity to learn, and that\nalso happened to have the best\ncompensation package as well. My first salary was $50,000 a year, and\nthen after my probationary period,\nI was making $65,000 a year. My benefits\nkicked in like health and dental. But the\nbiggest perk for me was that I got\nto work remotely the entire time as\nlong as I worked the US time zone. I'm\nnot saying that you'll be an expert\ndeveloper if you follow this plan. I'm just sharing what I did to\nlearn just enough to land me a job, as\nmost of the progress that I've had\nas a developer all came on the job. No luck here, just focused effort. Now, I've been\nworking in tech for over a decade, and let me\nbe the first to tell you that nobody\ncares about your credentials. Learning\nhow to code was mainly two things learning how to solve problems,\nand two, persisting until you find\nthe answer that you're looking for.

And also, if you want\nto see me apply these principles\nto something other than coding, like something\nartistic, click on this video. Where we're going to put it? Here?",

        "transcript": "ah let's learn how to codee today where do I start what the okay so you want to learn how to code there's tons of resources and you somehow ended up here I am sorry to hear that but on a serious note learning to code has been one of the best skills I've ever learned you don't have to be super smart to learn it and there's tons of free resources on the internet the only thing is you have to work really hard but the problem with a lot of people who try to learn the code is they don't know what to work hard on so I'm going to teach you the areas that you should be working hard on so you don't waste time quick disclaimer here I'm not here to teach you how to get a job in 3 to 6 months because it's not that realistic I'll be honest is it possible yes have people done it yes and people have also won the lottery that does not mean it's going to happen to everybody I'm just here to give you everything you need to get started and I hope you understand that so with that out of the way let's get started number one learn how to learn now I know what you're thinking sloth I'm here to learn how to code what do you mean learn how to learn all right all right I hear you but this is really important I swear this will help a lot learning to code is not about programming languages it's about developing a mindset for problem solving and continuous learning this is what separates the beginners from the professionals the professionals know how to solve their own problems and learn new Concepts pretty quickly so it's crucial that you understand how to learn but sloth is it really that important especially for coding yes it is let me explain why number one rapidly changing technology the tech world is always evolving new languages tools Frameworks they're popping up all the time if you know how to learn effectively you can keep up with these changes without getting overwhelmed two problem solving skills coding is basically problem solving each line of code is a solution to a mini puzzle learning how to learn enhances your ability to break down complex problems into manageable pieces and find innovative solutions three adaptability this skill is gold in the coding world when you're comfortable with learning you adapt better to New Challenges you're more willing to step out of your comfort zone and Tackle unfamiliar tasks four Independent Learning you won't always always have someone to hold your hand through every coding challenge being a self-sufficient learner empowers you to find Solutions on your own making you a more competent and confident coder five efficient learning time is precious right you want to learn to code as fast as possible well by learning how to learn you can tailor your coding education to be more effective where instead of taking 5 hours learning a concept you'd only need to spend an hour here's some examples to give you an idea you can use diagrams to plan a simple coding project then jump in and start building it and finally ask people for tips on how to improve it the key is to discover what works best for you and use it to make your learning as smooth and enjoyable as possible remember there's no one size fits-all in learning especially in something as diverse as coding while I can't directly help you find your unique learning style I can definitely guide you with General tips throughout the video to speed up your progress in coding and now for the big question where do I start coding is a vast jungle but don't worry I'll give you a map to guide you on the right path but I need to know a few things from you first what do you want to make why do you want to code do you want a big Tech job do you have an app idea want to make a video game okay that might have been too fast let's slow it down and start with two questions what do you want to make your answer to this question will guide your learning path to make sure you're not learning something you're not supposed to and end up wasting time it'll decide the resources you choose and the projects you'll embark on remember there's no right or wrong answer here it's all about what excites you and what keeps you up at night thinking I can't wait to create that now for the second question why do you want to code are you looking for a career in programming do you want to bring a unique app idea to life or are you just coding for fun this is what's going to motivate you when you eventually hit that bug at 2 a.m. and can't figure out why your code isn't working understanding your why also helps in choosing the right resources if you're career Focus you might lean towards areas that are easier to get a job in if it's a hobby you have more freedom to explore certain areas now that we've got your what and why let's talk about the how three what programming language should I learn the programming language you should learn all depends on your answer for those two questions there's no such thing as a best language but there does exist popular languages Let Me Explain what what you should research based on your interest if you want to build websites or web applications start with HTML CSS and JavaScript these are the main Technologies of the web HTML structures your content CSS Styles it and JavaScript adds interactivity as you advance consider learning Frameworks like react view spel or angular for more Dynamic and responsive applications from there you can start learning some back end if you want to build mobile apps your path depends on the platform for iOS apps learn Swift it's Apple modern programming language for iOS for Android start with Java or cotlin cotlin is the newer language and it offers more modern features and is now preferred by Google for Android development if you'd like to do both consider learning react native or flutter for those of you who want to build video games check out some video game engines like unity gdau and Unreal Engine unity and gdau uses C and gdau has its own language while Unreal Engine primarily uses C++ and for those of you who want to take over the world with AI and machine learning python is your starting point this area is not just about coding be prepared to learn a lot about math especially statistics calculus and algebra python is the most common language in this field for its Simplicity and the powerful libraries like tensorflow pytorch psychic learn and a lot of other libraries that support machine learning operations in each of these paths your foundation is crucial once you grasp the basics you can delve into more complex projects and refine your skills in your chosen area of Interest there's a lot more areas when it comes to coding so I strongly suggest you check out this video here if you want a highlevel road map of every main area of programming to get you started now that you have an idea of what programming language to learn we can move on four how to start learning to code so far we've discussed picking the right programming language and understanding your why but what about the actual learning process you know how to code first off let's talk about resources there's a wealth of information out there from online courses YouTube videos books tutorials and coding communities there's websites like code academy free code cam the Odin project and corsera they offer for structure courses that are great for beginners YouTube definitely has its fair share of tutorials but also don't overlook the power of books they often go deeper into Concepts than many online resources however there's a common Pitfall that almost every beginner gets stuck in that you should watch out for tutorial help a cycle of constantly consuming programming tutorials without being able to apply the knowledge in the real world and build real apps tutorial hell is one of the worst things to ever get stuck in you feel like you're not growing or improving where if you stay there you'll want to quit because you feel like this is not for you I was stuck at tutorial hell at one point and it was one of the worst feelings ever I really wanted to quit programming because I felt like this was not for me at all I kept watching tutorial after tutorial and I just felt like I never got better for some reason it's easy to get stuck in a loop of constantly watching tutorials and courses Without Really applying what you've learned while these resources build your foundation they don't always push you to the next level of solving real world world problems this is where the learning resources you pick make all the difference if you do prefer tutorials one of the best resources out there is today sponsored brilliant brilliant sets the standard for Interactive Learning for computer science data science and math brilliant stands out from other learning resources because it focuses on active problem solving and Interactive Learning which will help you get out of tutorial hell since learning is not about watching and repeating it's about challenging yourself and Brilliant does exactly that by customizing the content to your skill level to make sure you're learning at a comfortable Pace they offer thousands of lessons from basic topics such as loops and conditionals to Advanced topics like Ai and neural networks you'll never get bored since new lessons are added every month one of my favorite courses that they recently added is how llms work where you get to learn how something like chat GPT Works they explore topics like how do they predict the next word and how they're so creative and the best thing about it is I learn and remember the concepts better because of how interactive it is so if you'd like to try everything brilliant has to offer for free for 30 days visit brilliant.org slthe coding slw or click the link in the description the the first 200 of you who sign up will get 20% off brilliant's annual premium subscription you're welcome enjoy it now if you prefer something other than tutorials then the key to breaking out of tutorial hell is to start practicing Project based learning this means applying what you've learned to real world projects you can still watch or read tutorials like making a to-do list app but the key difference is to add on to the tutorial and build other features from scratch this way you're not just following instructions you're innovating and building your skills in a practical Hands-On manner for example let's say you're watching a tutorial on making a calculator program they show you how to add two numbers well you can add on to the tutorial by adding a feature of subtracting two numbers it wasn't in it but you did it from scratch and now you're learning even better start with small projects maybe you want to build a personal website or you know the simple calculator and as you work on these projects you'll encounter real problems and learn to solve them which is a critical skill in coding not only does this reinforce your learning but it also starts building your portfolio which is essential if you're looking to pursue a career in coding remember the goal isn't to get it perfect the first time it's all about learning iterating and improving each project you build will boost your confidence and understanding of coding and let me give you a quick cheat code you can speed this up even more by having a coding buddy or sharing your progress online let people see what you're building let them make fun of it let them improve it in the end you're going to be learning a lot on what not to do and what to do better I truly believe if I was sharing my progress online sooner I would be so much better I would probably be 100 times better than I am today you can join my Discord if you want to share your work I'd love to see what you're creating I just enjoy programming and that's everything that I have for you and I hope I gave you enough information to start coding so have fun build what you want and I can't wait to see what you build so I'll see you in the next video and uh have fun",

        "transcript": "- This is a video about the\noldest unsolved problem in math that dates back 2000 years. Some of the brightest\nmathematicians of all time have tried to crack it,\nbut all of them failed. In the year 2000 the Italian mathematician,\nPiergiorgio Odifreddi, listed it among four of the\nmost pressing open problems at the time. Solving this problem could be as simple as finding a single number. So mathematicians have used computers and checked numbers up to\n10 to the power of 2,200, but so far they've come up empty handed. Why do you think this problem\nhas captured the imaginations of so many mathematicians? - It's old, it's simple, it's beautiful. - What else could you want? So the problem is this. Do any odd perfect numbers exist? So what is a perfect number? Well take the number six for example. You can divide it by 1, 2,\n3, and 6, but let's ignore 6 because that's the number itself, and now we're left with\njust the proper divisors. If you add them all up, you\nfind that they add to six, which is the number itself. So numbers like this are called perfect. You can also try this with\nother numbers like 10. 10 has the proper divisors\none, two, and five. If you add those up, you only get eight. So 10 is not a perfect number. Now you can repeat this\nfor all other numbers, and what you find is that\nmost numbers either overshoot or undershoot between 1 and a 100, only 6 and 28 are perfect numbers. Go up to 10,000 and you find the next two\nperfect numbers 496 and 8,128. These were the only perfect numbers known by the ancient Greeks, and they would be the only known ones for over a thousand years. If only we could find a pattern\nthat makes these numbers, then we could use that\nto predict more of them. So what do these numbers have in common? Well, one thing to notice is that each next perfect\nnumber is one digit longer than the number that came before it. Another thing they share is\nthat the ending digit alternates between 6 and 8, which also\nmeans they are all even. But here's where things get really weird. You can write 6 as the\nsum of 1 plus 2 plus 3 and 28 as the sum of one, plus 2, plus 3, plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7, and so on for the others as well,\nthey're all just the sum of consecutive numbers and you can think of\neach additional number as adding a new layer. And so these create a triangle, which is why these numbers\nare called triangular numbers. Also, every number\nexcept for six is the sum of consecutive odd cubes. So 28 is 1 cubed plus 3 cubed. 496 is equal to 1 cubed plus 3 cubed\nplus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed. And 8,128 is equal to 1 cubed plus 3 cubed\nplus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed plus 9 cubed all the way up to 15 cubed. But here's the one that\nreally blows my mind. If you write these numbers in binary, six becomes 110, and 28 becomes 11100. 496 becomes 111110000. And 8,128, you guessed it. It is also a string of ones\nfollowed by a series of zeros. So if you write them out, they are all just\nconsecutive powers of two. What now around 300 BC Euclid was actually\nthinking along similar lines when he discovered the pattern that makes these perfect numbers. Take the number one and double it, you get two now, keep doubling it. You get 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. Now starting from one,\nadd the next number to it. So 1 plus 2 equals 3. If that adds up to a\nprime, then you multiply it by the last number in the\nsequence to get a perfect number. So two times three equals\nsix, the first perfect number. Now let's keep doing this. Add 1 plus 2 plus 4, and you get 7, which is again prime. So multiply it by the last\nnumber four, and you get 28. The next perfect number. Next, add 1 plus 2 plus\n4 plus 8 equals 15, but 15 isn't prime, so we\ncontinue add 16 to get 31, this is prime. So you multiply it by 16 and you get 496. The third perfect number. Now you can keep doing this to find bigger and bigger perfect numbers, and using this we can\nrewrite the first three. So 6 equals 1 plus 2\ntimes 2 to the power of 1 and 28 equals 1 plus 2\nplus 4 times 2 squared and 496 equals 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 plus 16 times 2 to the power of 4 where the first term is prime. But there's a more convenient\nway to write this still. Take any sum of consecutive powers of 2. So 2 to the power of zero which is 1 plus 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2, all the way up to 2 to the n minus 1. And now because you don't\nknow n, you don't know what that is equal to, but it\nwill be equal to something. So let's call that T. Now multiply this whole equation by two. So you get 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2, all the way up to 2 to the\nn, and this is equal to 2T. If you now subtract the first\nequation from the second, almost all the terms will cancel out and you're left with T\nequals 2 to the n minus 1. So you can replace this whole series with one less than the next power of 2. So six becomes 2 squared\nminus 1 times 2 to the 1. 28 becomes 2 cubed\nminus 1 times 2 squared, and 496 becomes 2 to the 5\nminus 1 times 2 to the 4. Do you see the pattern? This number is always one more than this. So if we call this P, then Euclid formula that gives a perfect number\nis 2 to the P minus 1 times 2 to the P minus 1\nwhenever this is prime. Now, because you're multiplying\nit by 2 to the P minus 1, which is even, this will\nalways give an even number. Euclid had found a way to\ngenerate even perfect numbers, but he didn't prove that\nthis was the only way. So there could be other\nways to get perfect numbers, including potentially ones that are odd. 400 years later, the Greek philosopher nicomchaus published Introdutio Arithmetica, the\nstandard arithmetic text for the next thousand years. In it, he stated five conjectures\nstatements he believed to be true, but did not bother\nactually trying to prove. His conjectures were one, the nth perfect number has n digits. Two, all perfect numbers are even. Three, all perfect numbers\nend in 6 and 8 alternately. Four, Euclid algorithm produces\nevery even perfect number. And five, there are infinitely\nmany perfect numbers. For the next thousand years no one could prove or disprove\nany of these conjectures, and they were considered facts. But in the 13th century, Egyptian mathematician Ibn Fallus published a list with 10 perfect numbers and their values of P. Three of these perfect numbers turned out not to be perfect at all. But the remaining ones are. The fifth perfect number\nis eight digits long, which disproves Nicomachus's\nfirst conjecture. And the next thing to notice\nis that both the fifth and sixth perfect number end in a 6. So that disproves\nNicomachus's third conjecture that all perfect numbers\nend in a 6 or 8 alternately. Two conjectures were proven false. But what about the other three? Two centuries later, the problem\nreached Renaissance Europe where they rediscovered the fifth, sixth, and seventh perfect numbers. So far every perfect\nnumber had Euclid's form. And the best way to find new\nones was by finding the values of P that make 2 to the P minus 1 prime. So French polymath Marin\nMersenne extensively studied numbers of this form. In 1644, he published his in a book including a list of 11 values of P for which he claimed\nthey corresponded to primes. Numbers for which this is true are now called Mersenne Primes. Of his list the first seven exponents of P do result in primes and they correspond to the\nfirst seven perfect numbers. But for some of the larger numbers like 2 to the 67 minus\n1, Mersenne admitted to not even checking\nwhether they were prime. \"To tell if a given number\nof 15 to 20 digits is prime or not all time would not\nsuffice for the test.\" Mersenne discussed the\nproblem of perfect numbers with other luminaries of the time, including Pierre de\nFermat and Rene Descartes. In 1638, Descartes wrote to\nMersenne, I think I can show that there are no even perfect numbers except those of Euclid. He also believed that if an\nodd perfect number does exist, it must have a special form. It must be the product of a prime and the square of a different number. If he was right, these\nwould easily have been the biggest breakthroughs\non the problem since Euclid 2000 years earlier. But Descartes couldn't prove\neither of those statements. Instead, he wrote \"As for\nme, I judge that one can find real odd perfect numbers. But whatever method you\nuse, it takes a long time to look for these.\" Around a hundred years later\nat the St. petersburg Academy, the Prussian mathematician\nChristian Goldbach met a 20-year-old math prodigy. The two stayed in touch\ncorresponding by mail, and in 1729, Goldbach\nintroduced this young man to the work of Fermat. At first, he seemed indifferent, but after a little more\nprodding by Goldbach he became passionate about number theory and he spent the next 40 years working on different problems in the field among them was the problem\nof perfect numbers. This Prodigy's name was Leonhard Euler. Euler picked up where\nDescartes had left off, but with more success. In doing so, he made three\nbreakthroughs on this problem. First in 1732, he discovered the eighth perfect\nnumber, which he had done by verifying that 2 to\nthe 31 minus 1 is prime. Just as Mersenne had predicted. For his other two breakthroughs,\nhe invented a new weapon, the sigma function. All this function does is\nit takes all the divisors of a number, including the\nnumber itself and adds them up. So take any number, say\nsix, sum up all its divisors and you get 12, which is twice\nthe number we started with. And this will be true\nfor all perfect numbers. The Sigma function of a perfect number will always give twice the number itself because the sigma function\nincludes the number as one of its divisors. Now this may seem like a small change, but it ends up being extremely powerful. So let's look at a few examples. Take a prime number like seven. Now, because it's prime, you can't rearrange it into a rectangle, therefore the only divisors\nare one and the prime itself. So Sigma seven is 1 plus\n7, which is equal to 8. Now, to keep things easier to follow, we'll just stick to the numbers. But what if instead of\nseven, you had seven cubed? Well, again, the sum of the\ndivisors is really simple. It's just 1 plus 7 plus\n7 squared plus 7 cubed. Now let's use it on a\ndifferent number, say 20. The sum of its divisors\nis 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 5 plus 10 plus 20, which equals 42. But you can also write this as 1 plus 2 plus 4 times 1 plus 5. And this is what really makes the sigma function so powerful. If you have a number that\nis made up of other numbers that don't share factors with each other, then you can split up the sigma function into the sigma functions\nof the prime powers that make it up. So sigma of 2 squared times sigma 5 is equal to sigma 20. And since any number can\nbe written as the product of prime powers, you can\nsplit up the sigma function of any composite number\ninto the sigma functions of its prime powers. With his new function in hand, Euler achieved his second breakthrough and did what Descartes couldn't. He proved that every even\nperfect number has Euclid's form. This Euclid-Euler theorem\nsolved a 1600-year-old problem and proved Nicomachus's fourth conjecture. Math historian William Dunham called it the greatest mathematical\ncollaboration in history. But Euler wasn't finished yet. He also wanted to solve the\nproblem of odd perfect numbers. So for his third breakthrough, he set out to prove Descartes other statement that every odd perfect number\nmust have a specific form. Because if an odd perfect\nnumber does exist, you know two things first n is odd. And second sigma of n equals 2n. Now any number n, you\ncan write as a product of different prime numbers and each prime can be to some power. So let's take that and put\nit into Euler sigma function. So you get sigma of n equals\nsigma of all of those primes to their powers, which equals 2n. But since all of these factors are primes, you can actually split up the\nsigma function into the sigmas of the individual prime powers. Now one thing to notice is that if you have a prime\nnumber raised to an odd power, for example seven to the power of 1, then the sigma function will be even because 1 plus 7 equals 8, you'll always get an even number because odd plus odd is even if the prime number is instead raised to an even power like seven squared, then the sigma function\nreturns an odd number. Sigma of 7 squared equals\n1 plus 7 plus 7 squared, which equals 57. Because odd plus odd plus odd equals odd. So if you have the sigma\nfunction of an odd prime raised to an odd power, it will\ngive an even number. If instead it's raised to an even power, you get an odd number. And this is where Euler's\ngenius insight comes in because here on the right\nside you've got 2 times n where n is an odd perfect\nnumber, and 2 is even. Well, what that means is that on the left side there\nmust only be one even number because if there were two even numbers, you could factor out four. But that means you should also be able to factor out four on the\nright side, which you can't because n is odd and there's\nonly a single 2 here. So only one of these sigmas\nhere can give an even number, which means that there\nis exactly one prime that is to an odd power and all the others must\nbe to an even power just as Descartes had predicted. Now, Euler refined the form a bit more and showed that an odd\nperfect number must satisfy this condition, but even\nEuler couldn't prove whether they existed or not. He wrote \"Whether there\nare any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question.\" For the next 150 years very little progress was made and no new perfect\nnumbers were discovered. English mathematician Peter Barlow wrote that Euler eighth perfect\nnumber \"Is the greatest that ever will be discovered for as they are merely\ncurious without being useful, it is not likely that any\nperson will ever attempt to find one beyond it.\" But Barlow was wrong. Mathematicians kept pursuing\nthese elusive perfect numbers and most started with Mersenne's\nlist of proposed primes. The next on his list\nwas 2 to the 67 minus 1. So far, Mersenne had\ndone an excellent job. He had included Euler's\neighth perfect number while avoiding others like 29 that turned out not to\nlead to a perfect number, but 230 years after\nMersenne published his list, Edouard Lucas proved that 2 to\nthe 67 minus 1 was not prime, although he was unable\nto find its factors. 27 years later, Frank\nNelson Cole gave a talk to the American mathematical\nsociety without saying a word, he walked to one side of the blackboard and wrote down 2 to the 67 minus 1 equals 147,573,952,589,676,412,927. He then walked to the other\nside of the blackboard and multiplied 193,707,721 times 761,838,257,287 giving the same answer. He sat down without saying a word and the audience erupted in applause. He later admitted it took him three years working on Sundays to solve this. A modern computer could solve\nthis in less than a second. From 500 BC until 1952 people had discovered\njust 12 Mersenne primes and therefore only 12 perfect numbers. The main difficulty was checking whether large Mersenne numbers\nwere actually prime. But in 1952, American mathematician\nRaphael Robinson wrote a computer program to perform this task and he ran it on the fastest\ncomputer at the time, the SWAC. Within 10 months, he found\nthe next five Mersenne primes and so corresponding perfect numbers. And over the next 50 years, new Mersenne primes were\ndiscovered in rapid succession, all using computers. The largest Mersenne\nprime at the end of 1952 was 2 to the power of 2,281 minus 1, which is 687 digits long. By the end of 1994, the\nlargest Mersenne prime was 2 to the power of 859,433 minus 1, which is 258,716 digits long. Since these numbers were\ngetting so astronomically large, the task of finding\nnumerous end primes became more and more difficult\neven for supercomputers. So in 1996, computer scientist George Woltman launched the Great Internet Mersenne\nPrime Search or GIMPS. GIMPS distributes the\nwork over many computers allowing anyone to volunteer\ntheir computer power to help search for Mersenne primes. The project has been\nhighly successful so far, having discovered 17 new Mersenne primes, 15 of which were the largest\nknown primes at that time. And the best part, if\nyour computer discovers a new Mersenne prime, you'll be listed as its discoverer, adding yourself to a list that includes some of the best\nmathematicians of all time. There's even a $250,000 prize for the first billion-digit prime. In 2017 Church Deacon John Pace discovered the 50th Mersenne Prime by using GIMPS. The number 2 to the 77,232,917 minus 1 is more than 23 million digits long, and it was also the largest\nknown prime at the time. To celebrate this achievement the Japanese publishing house, Nanairosha published this book, \"The Largest Prime number of 2017.\" And all it is is that number spread\nover 719 glorious pages. It's wild. The size of this font is so tiny. The book quickly rose to the\nnumber one spot on Amazon and sold out in four days. A year later, the 51st\nMersenne Prime was discovered. It's 2 to the 82,589,933 minus 1, and this number has\n24,000,860 2048 digits. But there's something I\nenjoy about the absurdity, like there is knowledge in here, but it's not the kind of knowledge that anyone's ever gonna\nread out of a book. But in some way it's nice that there's this physical artifact that like has the number, if ever we lost all the prime numbers. You know, someone could find this book be like, here's the big one. As of today, this is still\nthe largest known prime. And since numbers of this\nform grow so rapidly, the largest Mersenne Prime is almost always the largest known prime. Computers have been incredibly successful at finding new Mersenne primes and their corresponding perfect numbers, but we've still only found 51 so far. So you might suspect that there are only a finite number of them, which would mean that\nNicomachus's fifth conjecture would be false, that there aren't infinitely\nmany perfect numbers, but that might not be the case. The Lenstra and Pomerance\nWagstaff conjecture predicts how many Mersenne primes should appear based on how large P is. Now this is the actual data the conjecture performs remarkably well. But more importantly, it predicts that there are infinitely\nmany Mersenne primes and so infinitely many\neven perfect numbers. The Mersenne primes are\njust so large and rare that they take a lot of time\nand computer resources to find. But a conjecture is not a proof. And up until this day, this problem shares the title of oldest\nunsolved problem in math with the other open problem. Do any odd perfect numbers exist? The easiest way to solve this problem is by finding an example. So maybe we could just\ncheck different odd numbers and see if one of them is perfect. That's exactly what\nresearchers tried in 1991. By using a smart algorithm\ncalled a factor chain, they were able to show that\nif an odd perfect number does exist, it must be larger than 10 to the power of 300. 21 years later, Pascal\nOchem and Michael Rao raised that lower bound to 10 to the 1,500 with recent progress\npushing that number up to 10 to the 2,200. With numbers that large, it's unlikely that a computer\nwill find one anytime soon. So we'll need to get smart. What would a proof look like? Like how could we actually prove this? - I think the main idea\nthat people have been trying to approach this problem\nwith is coming up with more and more conditions odd perfect numbers have to\nsatisfy, it's called this web of conditions where it has\nto have 10 prime factors now that we know and maybe thousands of non distinct prime factors and has to be bigger than 10 to the 3000. And it has to do all\nthese different things and we hope that eventually\nthere's just so many conditions that can strain the numbers\nso much that they can't exist. - Since Euler, mathematicians\nhave kept adding new conditions to this web. - But so far it hasn't worked. - But there might be another path. When Descartes was looking\nfor odd perfect numbers, he came across 198,585,576,189, which you can factor as\n3 squared times 7 squared times 11 squared times\n13 squared times 22021. Put this into Euler sigma function and you find it is equal to\ntwo times the original number. In other words, it is perfect. That is if 22021 were prime, but it's not because it is equal to\n19 squared times 61. And filling that in shows\nthat it is not perfect. Numbers like this that are very close to being odd perfect\nnumbers are called spoofs. Spoofs are a larger group of numbers. So odd perfect numbers share\nall properties of spoofs and then a few extra ones. And the goal is to find\nproperties of spoofs that ultimately prevent them\nfrom being odd perfect numbers. For example, one condition of odd perfect numbers is that\nthey can't be divided by 105. So if you find that spoofs\nmust be divisible by 105, then this would prove that odd perfect numbers can't exist. In 2022 Pace Nielsen and a team at BYU found 21 spoof numbers\nincluding Descartes number, and while they discovered\nsome new properties of spoofs, they didn't find any that\nrule out odd, perfect numbers. So how large would an odd\nperfect number have to be? - They don't exist. - You don't think odd\nperfect numbers exist? - No, they don't exist. I wish they did. That'd be really cool if if there was just this one gigantic odd, perfect\nnumber out in the universe. They don't exist. No. - How are you convinced\nthat they don't exist? - There is something\ncalled a heuristic argument where it's not a proof. So if we had a proof, we'd be done. It's just an argument from, okay, we think primes occur\nthis often of this type. And you put that those pieces\nof information together and you think, okay, on average how many numbers should be perfect. - This argument, which was\nmade by Carl Pomerance predicts that between 10 to the 2,200 and infinity, there are no more than 10 to the negative 540 perfect numbers of the form N equals pm squared - With odd perfect numbers the heuristic says we\nshouldn't expect any. We've searched high\nenough now that we think we have enough evidence they\nshouldn't exist anymore. - My understanding is\nthis heuristic argument. It also predicts that there are no large\nperfect numbers even or odd. So... That's true. So there's a downside. Yeah, there's a downside because it says there shouldn't be large, even perfect numbers and\nwe actually expect there to be infinitely many. And so, okay, so... why do I believe the\nheuristic in this case and not this case? You're right. Am I being hypocritical about that? There are other aspects you can add on to the heuristic and make it stronger. Let me put it that way. But you're right, it's not a proof. - For now this is still the\noldest unsolved problem in math. Euler was right when he\nsaid whether there are any odd perfect numbers is\na most difficult question. So are there any\napplications of this problem? - I can say no. - Now, many people may think that if there are no\napplications to the real world, then there's no point studying it. Why should anyone care about\nsome old unsolved problem? But I think that's the wrong approach. For more than 2000 years, number theory had no\nreal world applications. It was just mathematicians\nfollowing their curiosity and solving problems they\nfound interesting proving one result after another and building a foundation\nof useless mathematics. But then in the 20th century, we realized that we could take this foundation and base our cryptography on it. This is what protects\neverything from text messages to government secrets. - Whenever you have a group of people put their\nminds towards a problem, something good's gonna come out of it. If it's only, if it's\nonly at the beginning, this doesn't work. Okay, well, as Edison\nsaid, I learned 999 ways of not making a light bulb. Eventually I got a good way to do it. It's the same with math. You have a problem and you throw your mind\nat it and others do too. And you come up with new ideas and eventually something\ngood comes from that process. - Einstein's general relativity was built on non-Euclidean geometries,\ngeometries that were developed as intellectual curiosities\nwithout foresight of how they would one day change the way we understand the universe. How many people do you think\nare working on the problem of perfect numbers right now? - I'd guess around 10 people currently have papers in the area, 10 to 15. If you're a high schooler\nand you just love mathematics and you think, I want a\nproblem to think about, this one's a great problem to think about. And you can make progress.\nYou can figure out new things. Yeah, don't be scared. Hundreds of people have\nthought about this problem for thousands of years. What can I do? You can do something. - Why should you do math if you don't know that it will lead anywhere? Well, because doing the\nmath is the only way to know for sure. You can't tell in advance\nwhat the outcome will be. Like this problem might\nturn out to be a dud. We might solve it and it might\nnot mean anything to anyone, or it could turn out to\nbe remarkably helpful. The only way to know for sure is to try In today's world, it often\nfeels like you've gotta choose between following your curiosity\nand building real skills you can apply.

I graduated from Columbia University last year and I studied Math and Operations Research.  In this video, I talk about why math can be very difficult and seem nonsensical at times. I share the system that I use to practice math problems in an enjoyable and effective way, and I explain how you can do the same. I understand that math can become very challenging when you don't find studying it enjoyable, so I hope this video can be motivating and helpful if you're currently struggling with math!\nThis video is almost a more complete and polished remake of my very first video on this channel.

        "transcript": "so you want to become good at math based on all the movies and shows we were told that math is for people that have high IQ and natural talent but actually become good at math is pretty easy even if you don't think you have the math Gene so take me as an example my name's Han I graduated from Columbia University I studied math and operations research because I majored in math and I got pretty good grades some people assume that I was naturally smart little did they know I was filling my math classes in high school but the materials just didn't make sense to me I couldn't understand what the teacher was talking about in the class I remembered that every time when I ask for help I can see the frustrations in their eyes because I'm just so confused being defeated by a math problem and just constantly looking dumb really didn't help my self-confidence I always procrastinated in terms of studying math or doing math homework back then because I know that every time I try the problems I just couldn't figure it out no matter how long I tried and that's just such a Negative experience so I end up like always tried to avoid doing math homeworks and just this thought of going to math classes make me nervous because being in a classroom and couldn't do anything else but just listening to the teacher explaining things that I have no idea what's going on was such an emotional draining thing and turns out I was not alone approximately 93% and adult Americans indicate that they had experienced some level of math anxiety you know what even though I was so terrible at math when I was in high school one day something just clicked and I finally felt like I cracked the secret Cod of becoming good at math so for context let me explain what I was doing back in high school I would try to pay attention in math classes and take all the notes that I can take and I spent lots of time looking through textbooks and I would really try to understand those math problems well I sounded like a hard worker right but something must be wrong when you spend all that time trying really hard but just have no result so little young H just thought oh I must be stupid but that's so far away from the truth the say is stop always trying to understand math but actually all you need to do is to practice so back in high school all I was doing was passive learning and basically no Active Learning so passive learning B basically means you receive information from outside sources and you try to internalize it such as listening to lectures or reading or watching demonstrations so Active Learning on the other hand means you have to actively involved in the learning process like engaging in discussions practicing questions and teaching others and there's so many research shows that passive learning are not as effective as active learning in math and Science Education so in real life we use math to help us solve problems like calculating how much tip you should live and in school they test your MTH skill by asking you to solve math problems so either way you need to know how to use math by practicing it you wouldn't say you can drive a car just by watching someone else drive and remembering all the traffic rules you have to get into the car and practice so you really don't have to spend a lot of time trying to understand math by reading it's like understand all the mechanism of how a car move what really matters is you know how to drive so if you want to be good at math all you have to do is practice a lot of questions but there is a reason why lots of people don't like math because when you go practice questions you either don't know where to start and you're just completely confused or maybe you can start by doing the question and you go check out the textbook and you go back and forth and you spend a lot of time in just one thingle question question and eventually you still get the question wrong that's just such a Negative experience I have personally experienced this so many times let me tell you nobody likes that this experience will only make you feel frustrated and defeated so let me share with you my favorite ways of practicing a question that doesn't make you feel like you want to stab yourself with a fork so when I encounter a question I don't start writing immediately instead I will take a couple moments to mentally walk through how I'm going to solve it if I have no idea how to solve the problem I will just give up yes you heard me right I will just give up instead I will just go look at the answer of the question I take time to thoroughly understand the answer and its Approach at each step once I've grasped the solution I set the answer aside and try to solve the question on my own and I will write each step down this time I won't give up too easily I will make a genuine effort to applied what I just learned from the answer and once I complete the solution I compare it to the answer key once again if I realize I've dant incorrectly or I'm stuck at a point that I can't quite recall I would just repeat the process understand the answer then attempt the question again independently until I get it right so a couple reasons of why I think this way of practicing a question is really really effective okay I just want to take a quick break and share that I basically only use my iPad to study math take notes and do all the homeworks and all the practice questions on my iPad the great part of using my iPad to study is that I don't have to carry all the papers and the books and pencil with me all the time and I can like copy and paste all the notes that I want and also I have just so many materials in there but the only downside is that I kind of miss writing on paper you know there's just something satisfying about writing on real paper with a real pencil that's why I was so excited to discover the sponsor of this video paper like paper like is this really cool screen protector it makes my iPad screen feels like a piece of paper so when I write on it I get the feeling back it's basically the best of both World digital paper that feels like real paper during exam season sometimes I would write on my iPad for like 12 hours a day and my hands like get sore at the end but with paper like it just makes using iPad much more comfortable they have this notaker collection that also has this little pencil grip in them which I really like because they just like make holding the iple pencil much more ergonomic and comfortable this collection also include a little cleaning kit that makes keeping your screen clean Super convenient you can just spray this to your iPad and you can just wipe it and clean your iPad which is just so so cool I genuinely think that paper leges just make my workflow much more enjoyable and just helps me be more productive so check out paper like use the link in my description and thank you so much paper like for spons answering this video so a couple reasons of why I think this way of practicing a question is really really effective at really safe time and I think it's a really efficient way of using your time so instead of spending a lot of time trying to figure out a question on your own and you might not even on the right track you might be completely in the wrong chapter you could have used that time to practice like multiple questions and I'm not saying that there's absolutely no value of trying really hard to figure out the question on your own all I'm saying is that if you look at a question and you don't know how to do it and you probably will spend a lot of time going back to the textbook and trying to figure it out on your own you could have used that time to actually look at the correct answer and try to understand the correct way because the purpose of practicing a question is to learn from this practicing session so it really doesn't matter if you get the question wrong or right the first time when you try this answer it really matters is are you moving on before you actually know how to answer the question compared to those scenarios first is that I did a question I got it wrong and I got so upset so I move on or the second one is that I know I probably can't do it independently then I look at the answer and I learn every single step and then now I do the question again and this time I try really hard so I know how to actually do the question so instead of spending the majority of the time in trying to figure out the question on your own spend the time on you know you can actually do this question the key is that don't move on to the next question until you can do the question independently on your own you are 100% checked that you know how to do the question don't try to just understand math by reading it you should make sure you understand the questions by practicing it and distribute your time more efficiently another common concern is that oh if you just look at the answer and you do the question you're just memorizing it you don't actually understand the question so the way I think about it is that if I actually understand the math then I understand the logic behind it example for a question it's given a and the answer is d i know the logic behind each step I know given a it should lead to B and I know given B it lead to C and given C it lead to D well if I'm just memorizing it I probably will just memorize oh given a then D so the fireman technique which is famous technique that help people to understand things better it's invented by Nobel Prize winner Richard fan it basically means that if you want to test yourself whether you fully understand something you explain it to someone else ideally that someone doesn't have lots of background on what you're talking about imagine you're explaining it to a child and if you can really explaining everything using the simplest language then you fully understand this thing I use this technique sometimes I just pretend I'm teaching someone else or it's actually even better when someone asking me a question I would just try to explain it to them that's a really good way to test whether you fully understand the question or not and a thing that I always say is that you might think that you're bad at math but you actually you're not I truly truly believe that everybody can become good at math and everybody experiened some level of math anxiety and that's completely normal even though I study some pretty high level math in college and I still had the same feeling as before sometimes if I skipped the one class I couldn't understand the next class completely the first step of becoming good at math is to believe that you can become good at math and whatever you're experiencing that's completely completely normal just the nature of math it has layers that you cannot skip so when you feel like sometimes you don't understand math why it doesn't make any sense because each New Concept each new topic is built on its previous knowledge for example if you want to learn calculus you have to learn pre-calculus first which means you probably need to learn algebra geometry and gometry and all those subjects has its own fundamental knowledge as well and all those knowledge basically can form a giant Network and this is also why school have prerequisites for stem subjects so if you feel very lost in your Calculus class and you're very confused why the teacher jump from one step to another step and everyone else seems like oh they just understand it and you have no idea what's going on it's probably because that's like a concept note that you're missing and they assume you have the background so they don't always explain it and when you're like facing a new problem or like you're learning A New Concept and you felt like you're slower than everyone else it's not because you're stupid or anything it's probably because you're not familiar with all the fundamental knowledge enough it's because you're probably passing at each step and trying to understand at each step trying to make sense to yourself while someone else that's really familiar with all those concept they can just like jump through those and then without even need to think too hard about it your brain is always working and it's slower in terms of like reasoning processing and conscious thinking like when you heard most of things the first time you your brain is trying to understand them have you experienced something like you read a book and every single word is going into your head but after like a couple sentence and then you realize oh shoot I actually didn't read anything and you have to read the sentence again because you were not processing them you're not using your conscious brain to think them and this part of your brain this slow brain you're using is when problem solving and reasoning happened and on the other hand we also have this fast brain that we relies on recognizing patterns and intuition thoughts or like gut feelings you really don't need to even think about about it and your brain just automatically processed it for you really really fast before you even realized it for example like this is a cat do you really need to think about oh what is this I have seen this before what is this oh oh I remember I saw it last time somewhere and then you're like oh that's a cat no you really don't need to do that because you have seen a cat so many times before so now you see a cat before you even realize it your brain already knows it similarly in terms of math if I ask you what is 1+ one you will know it's two you don't need to think hard about it so when someone is really good at math especially the people that are really fast with math they had more experience in terms of all those Concepts they just practiced it so many times and lots of the basic concepts like geometry or algebra they don't even need to think hard about it so when they're learning a new topic they brain is automatically relies on all those fundamental topics that they know so well so they takes way less time to process to excel math all we need to do is combine those aspects so basically by practicing and using our conscious brain so many times that it becomes second nature to our brain that it already internalized that we don't have to do the reasoning and processing anymore that's when we transform form our slow brain and all the efforts to fast brain and intuition so next time when you see a problem your brain will immediately recognize the familiar elements and put together a solution for you so if you think this video is helpful please hit the like And subscribe button thank you so much for watching I will see you next time bye-bye love you",

        "transcript": "- Most of us tie our shoe laces wrong. There are two ways to tie\na knot in your shoe laces. In one, you go counterclockwise\naround the loop, and in the other, you go clockwise. These two methods look almost identical, but one of these knots is\nfar superior to the other. It doesn't loosen or come\nuntied nearly as easily. To understand why, we need to delve into knot theory. This is a whole branch of mathematics that aims to identify,\ncategorize and understand every possible knot that could ever exist. So far, we have discovered\nthe first 352,152,252 knots. Each one has its own particular properties and characteristics. I think it's fascinating that there's something\nlike a periodic table for knots out there, but it's not pure math. Knot theory has turned out\nto be remarkably useful. It is core to the structure\nof proteins and DNA. It's leading to new materials that could be stronger than Kevlar. It's even used to develop medicines that save millions of lives. All of this just from trying\nto understand the humble knot. So what is a knot? Well, in our everyday lives, we see knots like this or this, but if you are trying to\nrigorously study knots, you want to be able to pull them apart so you can really see what's going on. The problem is knots like\nthis are held together only by tension and friction. So if you pull on them too hard, they fall apart. So in order to capture\nthe knot on the rope, mathematicians got the idea\nto connect the two ends. And now, well, you can tease\nthe knot apart to study it, but it will never fundamentally change. So in knot theory, all\nknots exist on closed loops. This means the simplest knot you can have is just a circle like this. Now, admittedly, this\nis not much of a knot, which is why it is called an unknot. Here is another knot. Again, it's made of a single piece of rope that forms a closed loop. Here is another. Two knots are only different if you can't make one into the other without breaking the loop. This is the simplest\nknot after the unknot. It is called the trefoil, and you can see that there's no way for me to turn this back into a circle unless I actually break it open, take out the knot and\nthen close it up again. Now I have two unknots. It is surprisingly hard to\ntell two knots apart by eye. Here is a simple mystery knot. Is it an unknot, a trefoil or neither? I'll give you a second to figure it out. It is in fact a trefoil, which you can see if I just untwist this and rearrange the knot a little bit. And our first complicated knot, well, it is actually just the unknot. I'm going to try to disentangle\nit so you can see that. There you go. It was just a single loop. In fact, these are all unknots, and this is where the problem begins. You can't just randomly tangle some rope and connect the ends. To make a new mathematical knot, you need to prove it's not just a tangled up\nversion of another knot. So how do you tell two knots apart? This one question, also known as the knot\nequivalence problem, is so famously difficult that it's propelled the\nentire field of knot theory for over 150 years. Alan Turing even wrote\nin his final publication, \"No systematic method is yet known \"by which one can tell whether\ntwo knots are the same. \"A decision problem which\nmight well be unsolvable \"is the one concerning knots. \"The results in this\narticle set certain bounds \"to what we can hope to\nachieve purely by reasoning.\". Previously, the most famous\nknot problem in history was the Gordian knot. It was said that whoever untangled\nthis massive knotted rope was destined to rule all of Asia. Legend goes, Alexander the Great simply came along and\nsliced right through it. That would not be a valid\nsolution in knot theory. And there are other\nfamous knots of history. The endless knot is seen as far back as clay tablets from the Indus Valley, and it was used in\nMedieval Celtic designs, Chinese knot work and\nHinduism and Buddhism. In Incan civilization, knots were tied on chords called quipu to track everything\nfrom taxes to calendars. You can even find a knot in the coat of arms for\nthe House of Borromeo, an Italian noble family that\nhas existed since the 1300s. The Borromeon rings\nare technically a link, which is just a knot with\nmultiple loops of rope. The most basic link is the unlink, two loops which aren't actually connected, much like the unknot. After that is the Hopf link. Then later, the Borromeon rings and more. But the knot equivalence problem was only encountered centuries later. In January of 1867, Scottish physicist Peter Guthrie Tait showed off his homemade smoke machine to renowned scientist William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin. Tait had read a paper that said a vortex ring\nshould be eternally stable in an ideal fluid. So intrigued, he set up two wooden boxes containing a kind of toxic mixture of ammonia, sulfuric acid and salt. When he tapped a towel stretched across the back of each box, the chemical smoke popped\nout of a circular cutout in perfect rings. Kelvin, watching, was\ntransfixed by the rings. He had been pondering\nthe composition of atoms, a fundamental question of the time, and suddenly he saw an answer. He declared that atoms must be made out of vortex rings of ether, an invisible everywhere medium. Different knots of vortex rings would make different elements. The shape of the Hopf link explained the double\nspectral lines of sodium. The simple unknot ring was hydrogen. Tait was skeptical, but as Kelvin's vortex model of the atom became a leading theory, Tait began investigating knots in earnest. In his mind, creating a periodic table of the elements with every new knot he found. The crossing number is an\neasy way to categorize knots. Just take the simplest form of a knot, one with no extra twists or tangles, and count up all its crossings. By hand, Tait discovered a three\ncrossing knot, the trefoil, then a four crossing\nknot, the figure eight, then two five crossing knots, three six crossing knots and\nseven seven crossing knots. One quick note, knots are additive. You can stick multiple knots\ntogether to make a new knot, like combining these two trefoils\ninto a six crossing knot. This is called a composite knot, but some knots aren't\ndecomposable into simpler knots. These are known as prime knots. Since all composite knots\nare just built from primes, people mainly focus on\ntabulating prime knots. Unfortunately for Tait, warning signs were on the horizon for Lord Kelvin's vortex\ntheory of the atom. Mendeleev's first periodic table\nhad been published in 1869. The Michelson-Morley\nexperiment sowed seeds of doubt about an ether in 1887, and the most damning result was JJ Thomson's discovery\nof the electron in 1897. So there were particles\nsmaller than the atom which were inside atoms. But Tait was already in too\ndeep with knots to stop. He had even roped in his academic rival and close friend James Clerk Maxwell of Maxwell's equations fame. Thanks to Tait's influence, Maxwell became a knot enthusiast\nfor the rest of his life. His last poem written shortly before his\ndeath from stomach cancer even begins, \"My soul's\nan amphichiral knot, \"upon a liquid vortex wrought.\" Assisted in part by hundreds\nof letters with Maxwell, Tait published his list of knots up to seven crossings in 1877, the first math paper with\nthe word knots in its title. Then Tait paused his\nsearch for seven years. In a speech, he stated, \"The requisite labor increases\nwith extreme rapidity \"as the number of crossings is increased. \"Someone with the requisite leisure \"should try to extend this list, \"if possible, up to 11.\" Two mathematicians took him\nup on his call for help, Thomas Kirkman and Charles Little. Together, the three of them were able to find all\n21 eight crossing knots, all 49 nine crossing knots and all 166 10 crossing knots by 1899, just two years before Tait's death. This was all done painstakingly by hand. Tait admits in his paper, \"I cannot be absolutely certain that all those groups are\nessentially different, one from another.\" In the process of tabulating knots, he had uncovered the central problem of how to possibly tell them apart. Somewhat miraculously, Tait, Kirkman and Little\nhad done a near perfect job with their knot tables. Their list stood for 75\nyears without change, until a single correction in 1973. But more on that later. For decades after Tait's death, little progress was made on\nthe knot equivalence problem. But in 1927, German mathematician Kurt Reidemeister proved a radical theorem. You only need three types of moves to transform any two identical\nknots into each other. The twist, the poke and the slide, where you move a string from one side of a crossing to the other. Now we can prove some knots are the same. If you can show that they're connected by Reidemeister moves, you've proven that they must be identical. But we still don't know how to prove any knots\ndifferent from each other because you could do Reidemeister moves on one knot for centuries without it ever looking\nlike the other knot. And maybe they're actually different, but maybe they're the same and you just never made the right move to show that that is true. This may have been where\nTuring was coming from when he called the knot\nequivalence problem potentially undecidable. But in 1961, mathematician Wolfgang Haken\ncreated a computer algorithm that solved the not equivalence\nproblem definitively for this specific case of distinguishing any\nknot from the unknot. That said, his paper\nwas over 130 pages long and the algorithm would've taken longer than the age of the universe\nto run for large knots. In 2001, building on Haken's work, mathematicians found a way to distinguish between\nany knot and the unknot by simply setting an upper bound on the number of Reidemeister\nmoves needed to connect them. If you check all sequences\nof Reidemeister moves up to that number, you can prove if the knot\nis the unknot or not. There's just one problem. That upper bound was two\nto the 100 billion n moves. As of today, the upper bound has improved dramatically to just 236 n to the power of 11. Now, while smaller than before, checking all possible\nsequences of Reidemeister moves up to this number is still unfathomable. For a single crossing knot, this is larger than the number of stars in the observable universe. In 2011, mathematicians\nfound an upper bound on the number of Reidemeister moves needed to connect any two knots or links, solving the entire knot\nequivalence problem. This is the upper bound. First, raise two to the second power, then raise that to the power of two again. This operation is called\ntetration, and it grows fast. Now keep doing it until you\nhave raised two to itself 10 to the million n times. Cap it off with n again. This is easily the largest number we have ever shown in a video. But even just to have a\nsolution is remarkable, given that Turing thought the problem was potentially undecidable\nonly 60 years earlier. If it's this hard to tell two knots apart, how have we managed to tabulate\n350 million different knots? Well, there are some properties of a knot that never change, no matter how much you\ntwist or tangle it up. These are called invariants, and these invariants will\nbe different for some knots compared to other ones. So you can use them as\nhallmarks of a particular knot. They're not perfectly discriminating. I mean, some knots will share invariants, but if two knots have different invariants then you know for sure\nthat they are different. Crossing number is itself aninvariant. Two knots can't be identical if they have different crossing numbers. But the crossing number is surprisingly difficult to calculate. You can put extra crossings into any knot, like just throw in a bunch of twists. Different variations of the same knot are known as different\nprojections of that knot. Crossing number measures the\nleast number of crossings a knot can have, but it only works for the\nsimplest projection of a knot, also known as its reduced form, but it's difficult to ensure\nthat a knot is fully reduced. Instead, we can use another invariant, one that's true right away\nfor all projections of a knot. So it'll give the same value both for a messy trefoil\nand for a reduced trefoil. This first invariant is tricolorability or whether or knot can be\ncolored in with three colors. Take a diagram of a knot and color in each individual segment. These are just separated\nby under crossings where you would lift\nyour pen off the page. Tricolorability only has two rules. First, you must use at least two colors because you can color any\nknot in with one color. And second, at crossings, the three intersecting strands must either be all the same\ncolor or all different colors. Basically no two colored crossings. There are just two\ncategories of this invariant, either a knot is tricolorable or it's not. Identical knots must match. So if one knot is tricolorable\nand the other one isn't, then you know they're different knots. It's hard to believe that\ntricolorability is constant across any possible\nprojection of the same knot, but since you only need Reidemeister moves to move between projections, we just need to prove that it isn't affected\nby Reidemeister moves. The twist is easy. Everything's one color already, and it stays that way. With the poke, the intersection of two colors\nmeans that the loop formed must become the third color. So we have three colors\nat every intersection. With the slide, you never have to break tricolorability because you start with three\ncolors at three intersections and then switch one\nintersection to just one color. So any knot will maintain\nits tricolorability, no matter what Reidemeister moves you do. This is a good time to note that we never actually proved\nthe trefoil and the unknot were two different knots, but we can do it now with tricolorability. The unknot is not tricolorable since you can't use at least\ntwo colors to color it in, and the trefoil is easily tricolorable, just color in each of the three\nsegments a different color. The crossings all have three colors, so it is tricolorable. Now we know every possible projection of\nthe trefoil is tricolorable while every possible\nprojection of the unknot isn't. So these two knots must\nbe different knots. This invariant isn't very specific. It only gives you two\ncategories across all knots. In fact, the next knot after the trefoil, the figure eight knot, isn't tricolorable. There's always a crossing with two colors. So how do we prove that this\nis different from the unknot, which also isn't tricolorable? Tricolorability expands into\na much more powerful invariant called p-colorability, where p can be any prime\nnumber besides two. Instead of using colors, we'll number each strand with integers between\nzero and p minus one. p-colorability has two rules. First, you must use at\nleast two different numbers. Second, at crossings, the two bottom strands added\ntogether and divided by p must give the same remainder as twice the top strand divided by p. Tricolorability was just\na simple version of this. If we go from three to five colorability for the figure eight knot, we can number the strands zero, one, and then this strand must give\na remainder of zero, so four, and this strand must give a\nremainder of two, so three. This knot is five colorable, so it's not the unknot. p-colorability is a huge tool. The unknot is completely uncolorable, so any knot with any\ncolorability can't be the unknot. p-colorability still\ndoesn't cover everything. Some of the most powerful\ninvariants right now, the ones that can distinguish\nbetween the most unique knots, are polynomials. The Alexander polynomial\nwas the first one discovered back in 1923 before\neven Reidemeister moves. Like p-colorability, it relies on only two rules. The first is that the Alexander\npolynomial of the unknot is equal to one. The second is that you can zoom in on any single crossing of a knot and vary it in three possible positions, forward, backward and separate. The Alexander polynomial\ngives a relationship between the three resulting knots. Let's do an example. What's the Alexander\npolynomial for the unlink? Well, if we zoom into\nthis separate crossing and then vary it, we see that the other two knots\nformed are both the unknot, so we can plug in one for both of them, and we get that the Alexander\npolynomial for the unlink must be zero. Then we can do the same for the Hopf link. Taking this crossing as\nthe forward crossing, then seeing that the backward\ncrossing gives us the unlink, and the separate crossing is the unknot. So the Alexander polynomial\nfor the Hopf link is minus t to the 1/2\nplus t to the minus 1/2. And now we can do the trefoil. When we vary this crossing, we get that the backward\ncrossing gives us the unknot and the separate crossing\ngives the Hopf link. So the Alexander polynomial is t minus one plus t to the negative one. The polynomial is designed so\nthat we get separate results for as many knots and links as we can, and this is recursive. We can calculate the polynomial forever for bigger and bigger knots. The Alexander polynomial stood\nunchanged for over 60 years as the knot invariant of choice. But in 1984, it was upended by an unlikely discovery. Mathematician Vaughan Jones had been working on a type of algebra for statistical mechanics, a concept in physics, when he realized his work resembled a series\nof equations in knot theory. He traveled to New York to consult knot theorist Joan\nBirman at Columbia University, who helped refine his equations\ninto a knot invariant. They met again a week later and tested it against knot diagrams from Birman's filing cabinet, quickly realizing Jones had discovered a brand new polynomial invariant. He scribbled down all their\nwork in a 15 page letter. The Jones polynomial\nis like the Alexander, but with the more specific\nequation for the second rule that lets it distinguish many more knots. For this discovery, Jones won the field's medal in 1990. The first new polynomial invariant kicked up a fervor in knot theory. Just months after Joan's result, six mathematicians each independently found an improved\nversion of his polynomial with two variables instead of one. The editors of the American Math Society published all their papers together, naming it The HOMFLY polynomial. Two Polish Mathematicians missed the news and discovered it again\na couple months later, upon which it became the\nHOMFLY-PT polynomial. None of these invariants works alone. Just like if you were\nsearching for a person, you'd start by checking a\nfirst name, then a last name, then a birthday and so on to eventually narrow your\nsearch down to just one person. Similarly, knots have\ndozens of invariants, which when taken together, uniquely identify them. With invariants to prove\nif knots are different and Reidemeister moves to\nprove if knots are the same, you can attack from two angles\nto meet the gargantuan task of distinguishing every single knot. But this method isn't perfect. These two knots were\nlisted next to each other in Tait's knot tables for over 75 years. They were the same by\nall invariant accounts. So Tait and Little likely\ntried Reidemeister moves to see if they could\ntransform one into the other. And once they failed, they listed them as two separate knots. Kenneth Perko, a lawyer who\nhad studied knot theory, spotted them in 1973 while looking through Little's\ntable of 10 crossing knots. Suspicious of their similarities, he pulled out a yellow legal pad to sketch some Reidemeister moves, and he quickly found a way\nto connect the two knots. These two projections now\nknown as the Perko pair are the same knot. So the knot tables of\nTait, Kirkman and Little were issued their single correction. And instead of 166 ten crossing knots, there are 165. It had taken decades of work\nto tabulate all 249 prime knots up to 10 crossings. No one dared tackle the 11\ncrossings until John Conway. He found all 552, and claimed he did it\nin a single afternoon. This was the last tabulation by hand. In the '80s, Dowker and Thistlethwaite\nbuilt a computer algorithm to count all 12 and 13 crossing knots. Thistlethwaite later joined\nforces with Hoste and Weeks to tabulate all 14, 15\nand 16 crossing knots in a paper titled \"The\nFirst 1,701,936 Knots.\" The method they used is\nstill the one used today, employing a computer to\nlist all possible knots and then using invariants\nto weed out duplicates. They split into two teams\nand crosscheck their results, aligning perfectly on all but\nfour knots on their first try. In 2020, mathematician Ben Burton single-handedly tabulated all\n17, 18 and 19 crossing knots, bringing the total number\nof known prime knots to 352,152,252. His project was so\ncomputationally intensive, several hundred computers\nhad to run for months before obtaining the final number. The hardest part of knot tabulation is counting up every knot and then carefully eliminating duplicates. But if you just want to generate a huge number of distinct knots, you can make alternating knots, knots with crossings that\nalternate over, under. This computation is much easier, though it leaves out most knots. And back in 2007, this method was used to\nfind alternating knots up to an absurd 24 crossings. So in total, we know of\n159,965,097,353 knots. Of course, we're missing\na lot in between there. Knot theory was always just pure math. All the algorithms,\ninvariants and tabulations were knowledge for the sake of knowledge. But in 1989, chemist Jean-Pierre Sauvage tied molecules around copper ions to form the first ever\nsynthetic knotted molecule. This trefoil knot restricted\nthe atoms from unfurling, trapping them in higher energy states to give the molecule new properties. Any type of knot tied in a molecule will change its properties, and we know of over 159 billion knots. So if you can tie a molecule\ninto each of those knots, that's 159 billion new unique materials created from a single molecule. Though after the trefoil, chemists have only managed to tie five other molecular knots to date. It's a difficult task. Since they can't just nudge\nindividual ions into place, molecules must be built to\nself-assemble into knots. Knot theory helps identify which knots match available molecular templates, symmetric knots are easier for one, and how to arrange those\nto assemble the knot. The most complex knot yet\ncreated is the 819 knot with 192 atoms tied around\na central chloride ion. This molecule holds the\nGuinness World Record for tightest knot in the world, defined as the most\ncrossings per unit length, in this case, eight\ncrossings in 20 nanometers. Since it's knotted around a chloride ion, once the ion is removed, this molecule is one of the\nstrongest chloride binders in existence. The field is still new\nfor specific applications. Chemists are just focused\non creating molecular knots before thinking about\nmaterials development, but they hope to eventually build things like durable fabrics stronger than Kevlar. Knot theory is also critical\nto biological processes that have saved millions of lives. Bacterial DNA consists of a single loop of the double helix molecule. This shape means that it\nalways forms a knotted link when it replicates, and the bacteria can't\nseparate into two cells with their DNA tangled up like this. So they have an enzyme called\ntype two topoisomerase, which snips and reconnects the DNA. This turns their linked\nDNA back into an unlink so they can replicate cleanly. If you inhibit type two tophi summaries, the bacteria can't replicate properly, and in fact they die. This is how some of the most\ncommon antibiotics in the world called quinolones operate. Human DNA, while not circular, is long enough to also get into tangles. Each cell in your body\ncontains two meters of DNA. That's the equivalent of stuffing 200 kilometers of fishing line into a basketball. When this mess inevitably tangles, human type two topoisomerases\ncome to make crossing changes. The human version of the\nenzyme is different enough from the bacterial version that it's unaffected by antibiotics. But human topoisomerases are sometimes intentionally inhibited. This stops replication and kills cells, predominantly the rapidly\ndividing cancer cells. So it's one of the most\ncommon forms of chemotherapy. Biologists needed knot theory to first understand the mechanism\nof type two topoisomerase. Once they observed it was decreasing the crossing\nnumber of knots in DNA two at a time, they realized it had to\nbe cutting and rejoining entire double strands of DNA. And there are many other\nobscure topoisomerases that act on DNA. Knot theory is used to analyze the knots they tie or untie and how they operate as a result. It's not just DNA that knots. 1% of all proteins have various knots in their fundamental structure. If they get misknotted, they malfunction. So being able to\naccurately tell knots apart helps understand these\nproteins' mechanisms, as well as how to potentially\nrepair or utilize them. When it comes to your shoe laces, both of the common ways to tie the knot are composed of two trefoils\non top of each other. I'm going to tie some rope around my leg to make this easier to see. When you go counterclockwise\naround the loop, well, then you form two identical trefoils on top of each other. This is also known as a granny knot. But when you go clockwise around the loop, then you get mirror imaged\ntrefoils on top of each other. This is also known as a square knot, and it doesn't loosen as easily. So we should all be tying\nour shoelaces like this, clockwise around the loop. Most of us aren't. I mean, I'm not, usually. I normally do it like this. A simple overhand knot\nis just the trefoil. The bow line knot, the most common knot for boating or just holding things\ntogether is the six two knot. And any knot tied without using the ends, also known as in the bite, that is just an unknot. So a slipknot is an example of an unknot. In 2007, researchers Dorian\nRaymer and Douglas Smith conducted 3,415 trials of\nspinning string in boxes to study how knots form in the real world. They ended up creating 120\ndifferent types of knots, some as complicated as 11 crossings. They found that longer agitation time led to a higher chance of knotting. Longer string did as well, except this probability decreased once the string was put in a smaller box, which restrained its motion. So if you want to keep\nsomething like headphones from knotting in your pocket where you can't adjust string\nlength or agitation time, then your best bet is to confine them to as small a space as possible. Raymer and Smith also proposed a model for real world knot formation. A series of loops are first formed when a string is placed into a container. Then when it's agitated, a free end of the string gets woven up and down through the loops, braiding itself into them to form knots. And let's see, a knot. So coiling up your wires is actually setting\nyourself up for failure because you're forming a bunch of loops for a loose end to braid\nperfectly into a knot. So instead, what you want to\ndo is restrict its movement, whether by using a small box\nor increasing string stiffness. DNA increases its\nstiffness by super coiling, and you can do the same with your wires. I just double it up like this, and then I twist from the middle. And this is going to\nstiffen the length of wire. Now, this is naturally going to want to sort of coil in on itself and it's going to look\nlike a big tangled mess, but all you have to do is take the opposite ends of\nthe headphone and pull apart, and there's no tangles, no knots. Their study won an Ig Nobel Prize. It has been cited in studies\nof knots in surgical catheters, and even linked to an Apple\npatent for stiffer earbud wires. Knot theory began as a\nfailed theory of everything, and for the next century, it was a standalone field of math propelled by nothing more\nthan intellectual curiosity. But in recent years, it's\nreclaimed its original potential. Today, knot theory is a theory of everything\nfrom headphone tangles to material science to chemotherapy. In 1889, Kelvin gave\na presidential address to the British Institution\nof Electrical Engineers about his failed atomic theory of knots. \"I am afraid I must end \"by saying that the\ndifficulties are so great \"in the way of forming anything\nlike a comprehensive theory \"that we cannot even imagine a finger-post \"pointing to a way that leads\nus towards the explanation. \"But this time next year, \"this time 10 years, \"this time 100 years, \"I cannot doubt \"but that these things which\nnow seem to us so mysterious \"will be no mysteries at all, \"that the scales will fall from our eyes, \"that we shall learn to look\non things in a different way \"when that which is now a difficulty \"will be the only common sense \"and intelligible way of\nlooking at the subject.\" Knot theory is a perfect example of how knowledge in one area can become a tool to\nunderstand countless others. From learning how to tell a\ntrefoil apart from an unknot, knot theorists have built all the way up to discovering brand new proteins.

I'm not just lucky I'm double seven double [Music] big tense chapter 15 night mission 15 here you may know me as 10 and 5. but on the quiet I'm also one plus two plus three plus four plus five that's right I'm a super special secrets [Music] on a top secret nighttime mission get one tidy step two drink cocoa [Music] battery level almost dead but you're right on top of it you need to open the cover take out the old battery then put in a new one as fast as you can that's three different tasks but I can do them all if I use the fours is it Target approaching one two three [Music] now witness the power of this fully operational disco Cube see how we balance I'd really like to try that game money presents [Music] triangle triangle triangle triangle triangle triangle triangle triangle how many blogs is that yes what an amazing show with so many new ideas who can forget the stirring sounds of one with I'm only one little book or this Timeless classic and of course the number Vision sensation [Music] [Applause] and singing star five with here are five ways to make five my friend now for our first new entry straight in at number six it's number bonds to six we're running five or five and one together we play games for fun we're two and four we're four and two we're also part of six and three six four three and three we make a pair we play games with extra player six four and five five and one ten out of ten a perfect score now you're in with a chance to win prizes Galore it's time for the speed round [Applause] some objects will pass you of all shapes and sizes just tell me how many to win our star prizes one cuddly toy is the first in the line then she read apples hey that was mine now three Rubber Ducks four folks going hot three paper cups with two more on top that's five all together what's that coming now two rows of three bullets no time to argue three doubled is six now what's coming next a big stack of bricks five on the left two on the right seven the answer I saw at First Sight no four bowler Huts four more close behind why hasn't eat just popped into my mind it's correct and would like to turn the pattern is it goes for greens they're a gap and repeat [Music] oh hand prints I love it hand and red top one hand two hands three hands got it next comes four hands hand hand hand and then a red one more and each time then red pattern and unlocked some idea [Music] oh that feels so much better no more sneezing I'm cured what hang on this isn't right we've got the hiccups oh it's okay I think it stopped [Music] oh I've got to get rid of these ups oh I know how to cure hiccups you stand on your head [Music] I think it's working one [Music] [Music] only if I can stop the trains [Music] one two three four five [Music] [Music] dead end sex is good with dice how do we get six [Music] six Hello friends here's my advice it's time for me to roll the dice watch me give a little drill and you'll know which way to go one two three one two three follow me [Music] seven doors which door is right maybe seven can help how do we get seven [Music] me me [Music] I am three I am one two three three blocks I could juggle one two three three balls and this means me three [Applause] one two three I'm so amazing who could possibly follow me ah three plus one equals four I am full have we met before chapter four Four's house hello I am one two three four four blocks one one is one two ones are two three ones are three four ones are four five ones are five six one's a six and seven ones are seven eight one zone eight nine ones are nine and ten of ones are ten sideways and seven ones are seven eight nine ones are nine and ten bonds are ten with ones you can make any number block now is it that clever if you just add one or a bunch of ones you can go on forever [Applause] I'm the fun times one times table it's 17. that's a big Target what it's accuracy that counts you need to pick your partner carefully good thing we train for that too come on eight that's it those first two get you to equals twelve plus five equals thirteen now go for the ban lost nine equals seventeen so to make 17 you need to partner with nine yes taking my 10 friend two away from nine will leave the seven I need or as we professional Temple to say find the ten see what's spare slide it down and pop it there that's a work of art eight is our time voting champion and he's better to award the trophy than 10. four four [Applause] and one more oh [Music] 13. that was lucky oh let's see a hand scanner must mean five so if ten can be five and five then I can be [Music] fifteen and five Hush Hush steps must be taken high five [Music] Tip Top two high up buttons to tap and I know the pair to do it if 10 can make nine and one then I can make eleven and nine give it your best shot oh my name's not twenty oh dear the rain's getting heavier two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen twenty all made of twos and we can keep on adding twos forever or at least until it stops raining wow oh oh now here's an interesting question what if it rained once what if it rained once [Music] I saw it all in the whatever to land was incredible one pair is two two pairs like four three pairs are six now let's open the drawer and four pairs are ten six pairs are twelve socks you cannot ignore seven pairs are sixteen nine favorite team that might be plenty let's have some new socks orange and blue socks and pants are twenty sideways one two is two two twos are four three twos are six are you keeping the score four twos are eight five twos are ten six twos are you ready [Music] that might be plenty but why should we stop now reach for the top now ten two Jesus [Music] get [Music] oh first odd Square next odd squid next art Square next door even odd England 24 by one my white Prime position so many rectangles oh yeah that's even more than we can make sis we might need to find a bigger name than super rectangle that's it I figured myself out I'm 24 and I'm a super duper rectangle check out my array display turn switch turn switch turn switch I can make rectangles all day and all night too how did you get on 23 just my Prime positions that's all are you sure all those blocks no other rectangles anywhere how remarkable It Feels Right somehow some numbers are very rectangly and some are not very rectangularly and that's okay I figured myself out I'm 23 and I'm happy being me [Music] ant just crunch yourself a cave we can hide in there you go first one you're smaller than me show me like three stars they want to meet you not eat you I'm a two by two square [Music] if you think that ride is smooth wait till you check out this move [Music] wow I'm two lots of three I've got two rays and three Rays no I've got three Rays too you know I could ride across just like six if I could get up there odd numbers like us just can't make a rectangle that's two blocks wide twelve said only one of us had to get to the top remember we could all work together to find a way I don't see how we're out of luck I can't make four blocks wide I'm stuck oh I can I can but I'm stuck here we're all stuck twelve must have made a mistake 14 is ten and four so I need four blocks more which makes one two three four five six eight the six equals fourteen uphold thanks to our team we've got a clear run at goal [Music] double six bridge is fixed [Music] one one [Music] [Applause] [Music] again four sides all the same Four Corners all the same run across by one down one is a square number foreign [Music] I'm 28 and I'm a pattern Pioneer Square with a hole chalky cross Tower with Windows get in hello 27 looking for something yes I'm just not sure what there's something I'm missing art is all about exploring new directions oh New Directions That's it [Music] three lots of three threes can make three Square nines and if you put us together in a new direction we make a cube I figured myself out I'm 27 and I'm a cute making patterns is so much fun in our top secret number base at Mi 15 our maths investigation agents are always on the hunt for hidden numbers I'm looking for bonds number bonds there are all sorts of ways to find smaller numbers inside bigger ones once you start looking some of our larger agents can carry teams of smaller numbers where they're needed a circus in need of rainbow jugglers an Explorer in need of a triple dose of luck or if you need a complete set of one to six steps can be taken 21. how did you get down here I took the stairs actually I am the stairs [Music] I'm back to work I've been looking for a number like you 26 step this way oh team of six is three notches that sound means its last rectangle standing only one player remains who can be split into teams but who is it is there are you sure there's a rectangle left hush last rectangle standing is [Applause] high five game over and what a game it was let's find out who won as the team's lineup only the not very rectangular number blocks are left and the winners are the SE and that is prime time Team tag two by six [Music] three by four [Music] what took you so long six by two and he's back in the race speed is what I need six by three [Music] I'll have to take the jump it's the only way to catch up you didn't make it last time so I'll try again three by eight oh super duper here they come they're blocking block who will do finish but 24 takes him for your clock [Applause] maybe someone needs a big Cube like me coming did somebody wanna Cube what's this who are you I am 27 and I am [Music] bit of a mess I'm the only Cube allowed around here the rest of you will be wonky shapes forever now let's have no more distractions hahaha [Music] as I was saying one three is three two Three's a six three threes and nine four threes a twelve five threes of fifteen six threes are eighteen seven threes are twenty-one and now the moment you've all been waiting for ten three three [Music] is complete a fabulous group a talented troop the finest performers you'll ever meet so please raise the rules [Music] greatest show in numberland drumroll please for the circus of three please [Applause] I'm 20 names and I love clubs being in them and making up new ones like square with a hole in club we need something to show your all members like badges Club Badgers there square with a hole [Music] and how about Square badges for squirrel Club [Music] oh thank you 29. hey I'm only just getting started super rectangles club step Squad League of eleven sweet um can you make lots of rectangles who are the opposite I'm a not very rectangular number who can only make prime positions and no others that's a bit of a mouthful how about prime Club come on everyone it's 15. everybody hide eighteen there you are everyone find a place to hide when 30 arrives with three we'll all jump out and say surprise got it [Music] um um no 21. Oh no just turn me back here oh the next one for a good place to hide hope I'm not late everyone and one more three years Super Duper I mean it's me 24. gosh history here yet step six more to explore it's time to go out and explore the world to find out what Clues it may hold it may take a day or a week or a month to see what Adventures unfold this month has 31 days I figured myself out I am 31 and I love calendars double double I figured myself out I'm 32 and I'm a Doubler now you know who you are I know that you'll go far the world of numbers only gets bigger and bigger so go figure 216. four eights alter block dance spin one two three four five six seven eight dance spin [Music] four eights eight fours [Music] all right [Music] eight fours sixteen twos may we have this dance [Music] [Applause] [Music] eight fours four eights so we can very tricky oh oh [Music] foreign [Music] ER alert tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle run for it it's not fair those strong squares could break this ice like oh I got you and look what we can do two-step shapes can make a square we can beat them at their own game oh step squads are the best no squares are but now the trickiness increases all of us are different pieces yes remember you can't lose and always check are there more clues this looks really hard what if we get it wrong then we just try again they said we can't lose oh they also said check for more clues look there are two areas marked the first two pieces that one matches that six could you jump up there please this strange shape looks a bit like you [Music] oh don't make the same mistake all day try turning me a different way a different way of course free raise and away three by six land again now that I can do three bye [Applause] amazing you're built for Speed 18. you can ride Loopers and double Loopers and triple Loopers three five five four that's because my brother and I are both super rectangles which means we can make lots of lots and rectangles so we can make one raise and two rays [Music] um that's not all we can both make raise six by three well yes that's true six by two but why do we need six Rays unless thank you we've counted to 20 and ones and in twos guess who's next thank you friends do you want to see some more we could count to 20 instead so four four eight twelve sixteen twenty is five five ten fifteen Twenty One have a girl I could count to 20. listen to me I can count to 20 in steps of three a three six nine twelve fifteen nineteen uh oh twenty one one gem at a time no no no that's too slow let's get three at a time three shells Three Gems one gem in each shell good thinking three three shells Three Gems two gems in each shell each time there's one more in each shell three more and three more and that's all of them 15 gems shared between three shells is five gems in each shell could sharing team [Music] hello nice and warm here now I am the genie of fire to win the final key you must share my 20 fiery gems into these four chests you have until my toast is ready go we need to make sure we find all 20. one four is four two fours are eight three fours are twelve we know how to tell it straight four four is a sixteen by fours or twenty six fours at twenty four seven fours of 28 8 Balls of thirty two nine fours are 36 and went all the boys [Music] four on the floor and one more four than the four before that's what fours are for to get funky on the dance floor or on the floor and one more four that's 24 28 132 now one more foreignty [Music] [Music] ten fours a 40. whoa sideways one five is five two five so ten three fives are fifteen trust me you'll go far four bags of twenty five fives or twenty five six five the thirty you know who we are now one more time let's take it to the top here's the star of the snow and vibes [Music] one plus two plus three plus four is ten five you're next five plus six leaves one block out the frame I'll slide it down and start again one me next one plus seven is eight plus eight is Much Too Tall whoa you've got six blocks sticky at the top slide them down for the next rocket plus nine is ten plus five my turn I'm feeling much better for that rest yeah five plus ten is ten and five would you look at that five rockets with five blocks left over together what have you got ten twenty Thirty forty fifty fifty five the Starship Explorer nine tens ten tens Heroes with zeros [Music] [Applause] [Music] you can count to 10. then you know that ten times table you just need an extra zero so make your favorite hero one ten is ten two tens are twenty three tens are thirty four tens ES [Music] anyone for tennis [Music] anyone someone no one oh there's not much fun with one one [Music] whatever this is oh a friend hello friend I am so happy to meet you it's fun here but even all of my wanna know here you are oh oh [Music] you're real I'm one so am I I'm another one hey I've got one amazing idea is more fun with one and another one ah five numbers

what better way to celebrate opening my new park than with fireworks May I present the sky at night [Applause] [Music] laughs oh wow [Music] you see one when we all work together the sky's the limit [Applause] ations [Music] [Music] two is a part of me and three is a part of me is [Music] entering Luna orbit launching lunalanda [Music] we did it the only thing left now is to plant the square Club flag I forgot the flag don't worry little one I'll take care of this and I promise no Rockets Square power only [Music] looking for this smaller parts like the slices of a cake you could cut it into four or eight or sixteen but is there any end to the fractions you could make [Music] what if we tried to build a tower to the Moon would it take a hundred years to reach the top [Music] might not want to think about the drop oh don't stop don't stop what if the number blocks each had a different name [Music] amount you'd have to count would be no difference but you'd have to learn new words for everyone plus fling plus pop equals fun what if three was the highest you could count to are you ready I'm nervous it's such a long way to go it's okay to be nervous but I know how Brave you can be and how much you can do and we'll be coming with you too after all you can make any number if you keep adding one one wonderful world [Music] and one amazing Universe to explore foreign let's go the signal the signal ten nine eight seven six six five four three two one zero master [Music] Starship Explorer 55 first interplanetary mission underway engage a loop and then a downward line that's the way to make a nine oh nine colors beat that oh that looks like fun can I have a go round in a loop like an empty hoop make zero zero colors oh whoops where's everyone gone [Music] oh that's better oh I'm sorry the one turned us all zero colors and itself too the wand where is it is it I don't know someone bumped into me and I dropped it oh maybe there's a counter spell in here foreign",
